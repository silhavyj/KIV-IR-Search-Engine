Bimini Bon Boulash was a finalist on the second season of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, later releasing their debut single, God Save This Queen.Organisers are also welcoming back DJ Jodie Harsh, who headlined last year's virtual event.Ste Dunn, director of Northern Pride, said: \"After hosting behind a screen for the last two years, we are delighted to be returning with an in-person festival and I can't think of a better line-up to kick off the weekend.\" The event is free, but the Friday launch is a fundraiser, with proceeds also going to support local artists, performers and creatives. He added: \"Like many charities, we've been hit hard by the pandemic and for that reason this year's fundraiser is more important than ever - with 100% of the profits going towards building and delivering the festival weekend.\" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram .
