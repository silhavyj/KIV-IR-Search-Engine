Elijah's mother Jenny Halse, from Sheffield, said: \"We are in absolute awe of the strength the Elijah's Star team have shown over the past six weeks and are so touched that they did this in our son's memory. \"We hope that the money raised through this challenge can make a difference so that other babies' lives won't be cut so painfully short.\" The boat carries the names of over a thousand premature babies and was named after baby Elijah, who was born at 25 weeks and three days, weighing 823g, in 2013. He lived for just 37 days. Philip Bigland, Mac McCarthy, Dean Frost and Jason Kerr are friends who all served in the armed forces.
