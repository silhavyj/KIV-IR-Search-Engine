Where is the Light, an arts project using lights and sounds, will be shown inside the city's cathedral from Saturday. The voices and stories collected are from interviews carried out online during the lockdowns of 2020.The immersive installation has been toured elsewhere to positive reviews. LED lights are installed which change with the sounds and as visitors walk through and around it.The installation features voices from Coventry, along with communities from Halton, Hull and Leicester. It is led by the arts collective Squidsoup and ArtReach, Maddy Smart, executive producer at ArtReach, said they collected voices of \"sanctuary seeking communities about their experiences of light in their life and what brings them hope\". \"The audience response to Where There is Light has been really amazing,\" she said. \"People have had really strong emotional responses to it.\" The installation runs at the cathedral until 26 February.
