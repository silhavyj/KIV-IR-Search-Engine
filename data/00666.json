Currently, anyone with symptoms or who tests positive must self-isolate for at least five full days. Health ministerGillian Keegan has apologised for not immediately self-isolating after a positive test result.At the moment anyone who hasCovid symptoms or who tests positive for Covid via a PCR or lateral flow test (LFT) must immediately self-isolate for at least five full days.The current regulations expire on 24 March, butthe prime minister has told MPs that he expects to lift them a month earlier , as long as the current \"encouraging trends in data continue\".Boris Johnson said he intended to set out the government's strategy for living with Covid on 21 February, after the half-term recess.He previously told MPs that as Covid becomes \"endemic\" (constantly present), the government will \"replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others\". This would be similar to advice for other infectious diseases such as flu. It is not clear whether the rest of the UK would follow suit.You must self-isolate if you develop Covidsymptoms or test positive. You don't need to take a PCR test to confirm the result, although clinically vulnerable people in Wales are advised to do so. You can now leave self-isolation after five full days if you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart. The day symptoms begin - or you test positive - isday zero . The next day isday one of self-isolation. You can take the first test onday five . If it's negative, you can take another test 24 hours later onday six . If this is also negative - and you don't have a temperature - you can immediately end isolation.The rules apply whether or not you are vaccinated.InScotland you must self-isolate for at least seven days - as soon assymptoms appear or have a positive LFT. You don't need to take a PCR test to confirm the result.You can end self-isolation after two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart - the first no earlier thanday six . If you don't have a temperature, you can stop self-isolating after the second negative test, onday seven . If the day six test is positive, you can take two further tests on subsequent days. The guidance applies whatever your vaccination status. Anyone leaving self-isolation is \"strongly advised\" to limit close contact with people in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces.They should work from home and minimise contact with people at higher risk from Covid. The rules about self-isolation after contact with someone with Covid are broadly similar inEngland ,Scotland ,Wales andNorthern Ireland . If you arefully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, butshould take daily LFTs for seven days (or until 10 days since your last contact, if this is earlier).This also applies to under-18s (18 years and four months in Scotland; 18 years and six months in England). If any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test. Close contacts of positive cases who arenot fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days.InScotland , they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative.InWales , unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms. Anyone who developsCovid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test.Self-isolation meansstaying at home and not going out. Adults shouldn't go to work and children shouldn't go to school.You should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies. No-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care.
