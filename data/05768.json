The list - unveiled in a new appeal by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Spanish officials - includes men wanted for murder and drug trafficking. Among the most wanted is Nana Oppong, 41, for the drive-by killing of grandfather Robert Powell, 50. The NCA's Steve Rodhouse insisted Spain was \"not a safe haven\". He added: \"Fugitives usually continue offending while on the run and these men will be known in criminal circles wherever they are.\" He said the last thing their associates would want was both UK and Spanish law enforcement focusing on them. Many of the suspects would be trying to blend in with Spain's large British expat community, and anyone with information should come forward, he added. The NCA's Most Wanted campaign partners with independent charity CrimeStoppers, Spanish law enforcement and UK police. The latest appeal - launched in the Spanish capital, Madrid, on Wednesday - comes after a previous campaign targeting fugitives,called Operation Captura, resulted in the arrests of 86 offenders. Among the most-wanted are: Wanted by Essex Police for the drive-by killing of grandfather Robert Powell, 50, who was shot eight times on 13 June 2020.
