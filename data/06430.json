The 240-bedroom hotel was added to the scheme in the Bargate Quarter instead of student accommodation.The number of flats has gone up from 287 to 500 - the shopping area planned has been scaled back to about a third. Developer, Tellon Capital, said the changes had been made because \"the way people live, work, shop, and socialise has altered radically\". Previous plans featured 185 units of student accommodation. A consultation on the proposals is beingheld online until 2 November after which Tellon said it intended to submit a full planning application. Buildings, including those along Queensway and East Street, have already been demolished ahead of work starting on the redevelopment.
