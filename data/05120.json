The event began with a parade around the city centre and was followed by a free music festival on Durdham Downs. Organiser Daryn Carter said: \"Thirty-six thousand people came to the amphitheatre last year so that's why we've moved the festival and doubled the capacity on the downs.\" Artists performing include Sonique, Sophie Ellis Bextor, Boney M and Mel C. About 12,000 people took part in the last parade but this year about 18,000 joined in, organisers said. Road closures and diversions were in place as a 50m rainbow banner was carried from Castle Park to the Lloyds Amphitheatre. Live updates: Bristol Pride 2019 The live music concert has five stages featuring 100 live acts across the day and into the evening. This year, several shops and businesses in Bristol have been decorated with rainbow flags and signs to show support for the movement. \"It is great to see businesses getting on board and supporting the community,\" Mr Carter said. \"Our challenge to them is what do you do for the rest of the year? \"We want to make sure we live in a society which is kinder, where equality and diversity is celebrated, or [people] simply live their lives and be who they want to be.\"While the streets were lined with supporters, a few anti-Pride campaigners were seen along the route.
