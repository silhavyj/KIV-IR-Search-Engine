Absolutely Fabulous star and activist Lumley has been honoured for services to drama, entertainment and charity. Celebrated stage and screen veteran Redgrave has been recognised for services to drama. Other celebrities on the list include newsreader Moira Stuart, dancer Ashley Banjo, 007 actor Daniel Craig and soap stars June Brown and William Roache. Joanna Lumley said her damehood was \"extraordinary\" and \"completely unexpected\". She initially thought the formal letter was bad news, but \"burst into tears\" when she realised it was offering her an honour. \"It was an extraordinary shock,\" she told BBC News. \"I put my head in my hands and sobbed like a baby. \"Then I thought, how has this happened? Is it a mistake? I truly was completely thrown by it, and thrilled to bits, and so touched.\" The 75-year-old star, who isa friend of the Royal Family , won two Bafta Awards for her role as fashionista Patsy Stone in the 1990s BBC sitcom Absolutely Fabulous. She also appeared in TV shows The New Avengers and Sapphire & Steel, and was nominated for a Tony Award on Broadway in 2011. Beyond acting, she has been praised for her human rights and animal rights campaigning. Vanessa Redgrave said she was \"surprised and grateful to join this wondrous group of British artists whose work has inspired me and audiences the world over\". She added: \"My generation fought for freedom of expression. Long may this remain.\" The 84-year-old is regarded as one of the greatest actresses of her generation, with six Oscar nominations to her name including a win for the 1977 film Julia. Her other films include Mary, Queen of Scots, Howards End, Mrs Dalloway, Wilde, Mission: Impossible and Atonement. The English actress is one of a coterie of stars to wear the triple crown of acting - winning an Oscar, an Emmy and a Tony - while she has also received an Olivier Award, the London West End's highest accolade. Deliverance and Hope and Glory directorJohn Boorman has been knighted, as has pioneering film-makerHorace Ov\u00e9 , the first black Briton to direct a feature film. \"Chronicling the lives, battles, art and culture of the African and Caribbean diaspora in Britain and around the world has been a lifelong journey and passion,\" he said. \"This award is testament to how far we have come and in many respects how far we still have to go.\" Also knighted are fantasy author, Games Workshop co-founder and video game entrepreneurIan Livingstone for services to the online gaming industry; and writer, broadcaster and former Labour politicianTrevor Phillips, for services to equality and human rights. Daniel Craig , who bowed out as James Bond with this year's movie No Time to Die, has been made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. It is the same honour that the fictional spy himself received, and which author Ian Fleming wrote in the 1957 novel From Russia With Love, was usually given \"on retirement from the Secret Service\". Bond producersBarbara Broccoli andMichael G Wilson , who are tasked with choosing Craig's successor, have both become CBEs for services to film, drama, philanthropy and skills. Elsewhere on the list, broadcasterMoira Stuart said she was \"so moved and lifted by this recognition of my work\" after becoming a CBE. \"Because over the years, since my first Radio 4 news bulletin in 1978 through to my last BBC News summary in 2018, I've been committed to public service broadcasting, which gave me the chance to shift barriers, open doors and change so many stagnant stereotypes,\" she said. \"No it hasn't been easy, but this magnificent honour means so much to me, and I shall cherish it always.\" Financial guruMartin Lewis said it was \"a great surprise and thrill\" to be appointed CBE for services to broadcasting and consumer rights, adding that it had been \"overwhelming\" to hear how his advice had helped people during the pandemic.

Novelist and screenwriterAnthony Horowitz - whose work includes the Alex Rider spy novel series and Foyle's War - and cookery authorClaudia Roden have both received the same honour for services to literature. Two long-serving soap stars - EastEnders'June Brown , aka Dot Cotton, andWilliam Roache , who plays Ken Barlow in Coronation Street - have been appointed OBEs, both for services to drama and charity. Roache said he was \"delighted\" to receive \"such a wonderful honour\". He added: \"I can't tell you how proud I am!Coronation Street has given me so much in life and I absolutely love the programme and everyone who works on the show.\" Brown, who left the BBC drama in 2020, said: \"It is a great honour and I would like to thank Her Majesty, and all those involved in my recommendation.\" Another EastEnder,Nitin Ganatra , has been appointed OBE for services to drama, while Corrie starCherylee Houston said she was \"honoured and humbled\" to become an MBE for services to drama and people with disabilities.
