Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service said she was stuck 18ft (5.4m) above the ground in Trowbridge. Firefighters used a ladder to bring the woman safely down to ground level in Woodlands Edge on Saturday morning. The fire service said it was a \"reminder of the danger\" posed when people try to perform their own rescues. Crews from Trowbridge, Chippenham, Warminster and Devizes were sent to help the woman. \"Once in attendance [the] Trowbridge crew confirmed only one other fire engine was required so that a 12-metre ladder could be used to assist the member of the public to safety,\" a fire service spokesman said. \"We of course understand the emotional attachments to pets of any species, but please take this incident as a reminder of the danger posed by attempting to rescue without any specialist assistance.\" Follow BBC West on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
