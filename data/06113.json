Co-owner Kerry Michael made the statement following a meeting with contractors earlier. The attraction was expected to be completed on 25 June. Its previous pavilion was destroyed by a huge fire in July 2008. Mr Michael, who co-owns the pier with his sister, said he was \"bitterly disappointed at the continued delay\". Mr Michael said: \"It is now clear that contractors are still some time away from completion.\"Unfortunately, they were unable to advise us of a revised date for handover and we in turn, cannot set a date for opening until they do. \"We are bitterly disappointed at the continued delay which we understand is causing uncertainty and concern for many people, not only those who are looking forward to the new pavilion and its facilities but also for our suppliers, staff and other businesses in the town.\" \"We will do everything we can to ensure the Grand Pier reopens as soon as practically possible but until such time as we have a completion date from contractors, we can do no more,\" he added.
