Outlining an updated budget for 2020-21 to Tynwald, Treasury Minister Alfred Cannan said the pandemic had posed an \"immediate, credible and serious threat\" to the island's economy. It is estimated the shortfall in government income for the year will be between \u00a3120m and \u00a3190m. Mr Cannan said the fund would help businesses and \"promote innovation\".He said it could create up to 1,000 retraining and employment opportunities, expand \"the opportunities for developing core skills\" and help \"businesses to grow and develop\". The government would \"plant the seeds now that will bear fruit in 2021 and beyond\", he added. The budget revealed that to stimulate the economy, more than \u00a36m worth of capital projects had been brought forward, including \u00a34m for the acceleration of the Douglas Promenade refurbishment scheme. That figure includes a \u00a3750,000 overspend, which will be funded with money earmarked for heritage railway projects. Other projects brought forward include the island's heritage trail, the establishment of national footpaths and glens, and the refurbishment of several residential roads. The budget also showed that between April and May, more than \u00a330m was paid out in business and salary support schemes, a figure that is expected to rise to more the \u00a3140m by the end of March 2021. This will include spending on a new scheme for social care workers who do not qualify for sick pay, which will provide up to \u00a3150 per week to those who have to self-isolate for 14 days. The shortfall in government income is due to dips in VAT, income tax and air passenger duty. In addition, increased spending coupled with reductions in income are expected to leave government departments about \u00a322m short, including \u00a37m in health and \u00a39m in infrastructure, which will be covered by the contingency fund. Tynwald was told a \u00a3250m loan facility has been negotiated as a \"precautionary measure\". Mr Cannan said it would provide \"an important element of flexibility as we continue to meet the immediate financial challenge and then look to invest in the future\".
