Margaret Lang, 67, was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident at about 12:15 on Friday . The collision involved her Audi Q3 and a Vauxhall Zafira on the road between Crosshands, Mauchline, and Crossroads, Kilmarnock. The 72-year-old Vauxhall driver is in a serious condition at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. The family of Ms Lang said: \"Our family is deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved wife, mother and devoted grandmother.
