The Green party's spokesperson for transport was not doing this for the first time - she was a minister three years ago when she took a similar trip. Ms Genter, 41, is a well-known and outspoken cycling advocate. The US-born politician said her contractions \"weren't that bad\" when she and her husband decided to cycle.
