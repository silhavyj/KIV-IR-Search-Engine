Yasmin Chkaifi, 43, was found dead on Chippenham Road, Maida Vale, just after 09:00 GMT on Monday, along with 41-year-old Leon McCaskie, who also died. Mr McCaskie, who the Met said stabbed Ms Chaifki, was hit by a car driven by a 26-year-old man. The driver was arrested on suspicion of murder but has now been bailed. On Monday, eyewitness Mulugeta Asseratte said he heard shouts of \"stop it, stop it\" and described \"a girl being attacked by a gentleman\". Det Ch Insp Neil Rawlinson said the driver had been \"fully co-operative\" and had since been bailed to mid-February, adding: \"There are no outstanding suspects.\" Urging people not to speculate, he said: \"A man, who was the driver of a car, has been arrested and bailed for a very serious offence and we must carry out a full investigation, looking at all the circumstances.\" Det Ch Insp Rawlinson said \"very courageous\" bystanders had \"bravely tried to intervene\" to stop the attack and his team was getting a clearer idea of events from witnesses, the families, and CCTV. He thanked those who had already come forward with information but urged anyone yet to speak to police to help them \"fully understand why this dreadful incident happened\". Post-mortem examinations on Ms Chkaifi and Mr McCaskie, who also used the surname McCaskre, are due to take place on Tuesday and Thursday. Follow BBC London onFacebook ,Twitter andInstagram .
