Sophie Martyn and her father Lee, 43, were shot dead by Jake Davison, 22, in Plymouth on 12 August. About 300 people filled the Minster Church of St Andrew, in Royal Parade, Plymouth, many of them dressed in black.Other mourners waited outside during the hour-long service. A single white coffin was taken into and out of the church by pallbearers. The shootings in the Keyham area of the city saw Davison kill his 51-year-old mother, Maxine, at a house in Biddick Drive, during an argument. The apprentice crane driver then went into the street and killed the Martyns as they walked their pet dog. He also killed Stephen Washington, 59, in a nearby park, before shooting Kate Shepherd, 66, on Henderson Place.. Davison then turned the gun on himself before armed police reached him. Inquests into the deaths of Davison and his five victims have been opened and adjourned by a coroner, saying they all died from shotgun wounds. Three separate inquiries, by the Plymouth coroner, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) and the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC), are under way in the incident.
