Ex on the Beach star Ashley wrote: \"Rest in Paradise Princess. I will always hold you in my heart until I can hold you again in heaven.\" Azaylia's mum said her baby was \"my angel, my heartbeat, my soul.\" She added: \"RIP my precious baby, you will always be with me like a handprint on my heart.\" In November, the couple - from Nuneaton in Warwickshire - had urged people to register as stem cell donors after being told their daughter needed a transplant.
