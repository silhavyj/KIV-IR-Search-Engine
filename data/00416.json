Vikkstar - who has more than seven million subscribers on YouTube - said the game was in \u201cthe worst state it has ever been\u201d. Warzone was released last March and has been played by more than 50 million people worldwide. Activision, the publisher, previously said it has a zero tolerance for cheaters. UK-based Vikkstar - whose real name is Vikram Singh Barn - explained why he was leaving in a videoon YouTube. \u201cThe game is in the worst state it's ever been, Activision really isn\u2019t addressing how many hackers are in the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThis needs to be fixed otherwise it truly will be the death of the game.\u201d The video also shows gameplay where Vikkstar claimed to encounter one hacker live-streaming their actions on Facebook, while also playing the game.\u201cWhat an absolute joke,\u201d he said.\u201cWe just happened to catch these guys in it but often you don\u2019t even know when people are doing what we have just witnessed.\u201d Hackers could be encountered in almost every lobby of the game, he added. This comes just over a week after another popular Call of Duty streamer, NickMercs, announced he would no longer compete in tournaments on the game. In a stream on Twitch, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s all kind of hacks\u2026 there's no pride in this thing [playing tournaments] any more.\"Where\u2019s the dignity? Where\u2019s the honour system?\" Last April, Activisionpublished a message on its blog, saying: \"Warzone has zero-tolerance for cheaters. \u201cWe take all forms of cheating very seriously, maintaining a level and fair playing field for everyone is among our highest priorities,\" it added.\"This is an area we have been working on heavily, but it isn\u2019t always something we discuss publicly.\u201d The company had issued more than 70,000 permanent bans on accounts since the game\u2019s release, the blog said. \u201cWe recognise that there\u2019s no single solution for combating cheaters, it\u2019s a constant enforcement every day, 24/7. Rest assured, we\u2019re committed to ensuring a fun and fair experience for everyone.\u201d The BBC has contacted Activision for a response to the latest complaints. One example of how players can cheat is by using a so-called \"aimbot\". This allows accurate shooting of competitors without having to manually aim.Another popular cheat is a \"wall hack\", which allows the user to see the location of other players in the game, and attack them through opaque objects like walls. Other hacks let users hide and win by default, or heal themselves an infinite amount of times. \u201cTypically, these pieces of software are difficult to write but easy to set up,\u201d said Sam Connolly, an expert in computing at the University of Central Lancashire.\u201cCheats are often downloaded by hackers and set up on their own computers with relative ease. \u201cCall of Duty has always had a history of hackers\u2026 unfortunately it\u2019s an issue which is not unique to one type of game, but seems widespread across lots of first-person shooters.\u201c Players have called on Activision to implement anti-cheat technologies to address the issue. Other games, includingFortnite and Fall Guys, have developed software to tackle attempts to unfairly win their own battle royale last-player-standing titles. \u201cAn issue with this type of anti-cheat software program is that genuine players will be mistakenly banned on a larger scale, and the unbanning process is typically quite onerous,\u201d said Louise Shorthouse, senior analyst at Ampere Analysis. \u201cThere have been suggestions of hacking during official Warzone tournaments, which is extremely damaging for the competitive integrity of the Call of Duty brand.\u201d Activision recently announced plans to bring Warzone to its professional e-sports Call of Duty League. \u201cWithout addressing the cheating problem, its success and reputation as an e-sport will undoubtedly suffer,\u201d Ms Shorthouse added.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55893817"}
