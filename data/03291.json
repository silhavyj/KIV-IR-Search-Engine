Typhoons from RAF Lossiemouth in Moray and a Voyager air-to-air fuel tanker from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire were involved in the mission. On Wednesday , Lossiemouth pilots tracked four Russian military aircraft off the north of Scotland. Incidents like this - known as quick reaction alerts (QRAs) - are not uncommon. QRAs involve RAF crews shadowing Russian military aircraft near UK airspace and have occurred since the Cold War era but this week's incidents have come amid mounting tensions in eastern Europe. The US and its allies have accused Russia of planning to invade Ukraine , something Russia has repeatedly denied. Confirming the latest QRA, the RAF said: \"Quick reaction alert Typhoon fighters based at RAF Lossiemouth supported by a Voyager from RAF Brize Norton were scrambled today against aircraft approaching the UK area of interest.\"Subsequently we intercepted and escorted two Russian Tu-95 Bear F aircraft.\" The incident is understood to have taken place off Scotland. The RAF jets shadowed the Russian aircraft as they travelled through international airspace \"within the UK's area of interest\". They did not enter UK airspace.On Wednesday, two Russian Tu-95 Bear H, which are long-range bombers, and two Tu-142 Bear F aircraft were tracked by the RAF.
