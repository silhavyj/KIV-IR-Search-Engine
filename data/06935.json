South Wales Police wrote to secondary schools in Barry following the incident near the town's waterfront. The bus and other vehicles had to make emergency stops, and the 12-year-old boys weren't hurt. E-scooters are classed as motor vehicles and can't be used on paths or roads unless part of a trial. Community support officer Laura Berry, said: \"Following this incident, local schools have agreed to disseminate advice to parents and pupils, so they can make an informed decision before purchasing an e-scooter as a Christmas present. \"Christmas is fast approaching and while electric scooters appear to be a must-have present there are growing safety concerns. \"We are seeing increasing number of scooters in Barry and have witnessed a number of near misses involving young people narrowly escaping injury.\" Last month, South Wales Police seized 23 e-scooters following complaints from the public.
