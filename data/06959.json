The Met Office said \"strong to gale force winds\" of up to 65mph in some parts are likely to start from 20:00 BST on Thursday until midday Friday.The storm is expected to hit south Wales' coast from Monmouthshire in the east, to Pembrokeshire in the west. Showery to heavy rain is also expected to accompany these high winds at times. It comes just over a week after theMet Office issued the UK's first extreme heat warning , which saw temperatures in Wales reach highs of 32.2C (88.1F) in Gogerddan, near Aberystwyth.The areas the wind warning will cover include: Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Monmouthshire, Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Pembrokeshire, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Swansea and the Vale of Glamorgan. Although the likelihood of damage in Wales is lower than in southern England, mobile phone coverage could be affected as well as road, rail and ferry services. Injuries could occur from large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts,the Met Office warned .\"Gusts of 45-55mph are expected quite widely with a chance of gusts of 60-65mph in the most exposed coastal spots.
