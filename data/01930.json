Councillor Rebecca Smith, chair of the commission, says she wants to offer support to victims and tackle the \"issue at the root\". The commission will meet for the first time on Monday. Ms Smith said: \"Many women and girls sadly do still feel fear, intimidation, harassment and helplessness on a regular basis. \"Too often the responsibility for tackling male violence against women and girls falls on women. In Plymouth, we want to tackle this issue at the root, whilst supporting anyone who is a victim of this type of crime. \"We have put together an extensive panel of experts from across Plymouth and beyond, who are all committed to the same goal, and I look forward to working with them over the weeks and months ahead. \"One of the first things our commission will be looking at is ensuring that we have a wide engagement programme, ensuring that as many voices as possible across Plymouth have an opportunity to help shape our work,\" she said.
