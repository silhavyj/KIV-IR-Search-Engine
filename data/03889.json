A rescue operation was launched on Sunday after the man crashed at the site above Hundred House near Llandrindod Wells in Powys. Firefighters, paramedics and mountain rescue teams were called to the scene at about 14:00 BST. The pilot was flown to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff with head, leg and pelvic injuries. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said crews were called in to help from Ammanford in Carmarthenshire, Pontardawe in the Swansea Valley, and Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, along with Powys firefighters from Llandrindod and Builth. The pilot was stabilised at the scene by Helimed flying doctors from theEmergency Medical Retrieval Service , while rescuers struggled for nearly three hours to free him from tree branches. The man was eventually winched onto a coastguard rescue helicopter, before being taken the 65 miles (105km) to Cardiff for emergency care. The incident was declared over just after 17:00. Mark Jones from Brecon Mountain Rescue team said the man \"had sustained very serious injuries and was lucky to be alive.\" He said the team had seen a marked increase in callouts since lockdown restrictions eased last month, as more people travelled to mountains and beauty spots in recent weeks. Mr Jones said many may be unprepared or have lost fitness after only having access to parks during lockdown, and urged people to prepare before heading back into the hills and mountains.
