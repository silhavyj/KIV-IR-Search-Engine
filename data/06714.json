The PM and president of the European Commission spoke earlier about the UK's suggested changes to the Northern Ireland protocol. Ms von der Leyen said that the EU will \"not renegotiate\" the original deal.

That was why we had set out proposals for significant changes to it. \"There is a huge opportunity to find reasonable, practical solutions to the difficulties facing people and businesses in Northern Ireland, and thereby to put the relationship between the UK and the EU on a better footing.\"We didn't expect the EU to take such a purist or maximalist approach\u2026 we've not called for the scrapping of the protocol at this time.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57930799"}
