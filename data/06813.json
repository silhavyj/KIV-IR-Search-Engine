They join Welsh laverbread, Anglesey sea salt and Carmarthen ham in having the European Commission-awarded status. Protected status means certain food and drink must be made in a specific geographical area to be given the name. Welsh Perry and Cider Society chairwoman Sally Perks said she was \"thrilled\". Protected Geographical Indication status is intended to ensure people know they are drinking or eating an authentic product from a specific area. There are 14 Welsh products with protected status, but this is the first time drinks have made the list. Ms Perks said: \"It provides a huge boost to Welsh cider makers in getting their products recognised throughout the UK and abroad.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-40174526"}
