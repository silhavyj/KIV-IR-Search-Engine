Fionnt\u00e1n McGarvey was assaulted outside a bar on Finaghy Road North in Belfast in the early hours of 27 December, police said. He was taken to hospital for treatment to his injuries but died on Thursday. A 21-year-old man was arrested on Thursday morning on suspicion of murder and was later released on bail pending further inquiries. Mr McGarvey's family said they were \"devastated to lose our beautiful son\". They said they took comfort that his wish to donate his organs would \"provide other families with hope at our time of deep loss\". \"The family is grateful for the many messages of sympathy and support we have received,\" they said. \"We would ask for privacy at this most difficult time.\" Mr McGarvey was a keen gaelic football player. St Brigid's Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club in Belfast, of which he was a member, offered its condolences to his family. Queens University Belfast (QUB), where he studied and played sport, posted a tribute to him on Twitter. \"All Queen's GAA activity will cease with immediate effect this evening,\" the university said in a social media post. Aquinas Football Club said he had represented the club from age seven. Det Ch Insp Raymond Phelan said there had been a large number of people in the area at the time of the assault. Police want anyone who may have witnessed the assault or have any information about it to contact them. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60074679"}
