The Christmas convoy was driven through Baldock, Letchworth and Hitchin on Saturday, seen by a 1,000-strong crowd. Organiser Richard Hill, a farmer contractor from St Ippolyts, said the event was \"amazing\" and \"lifted everyone's spirits\". It was to raise funds for theGarden House Hospice , in Letchworth. Mr Hill said the procession was organised to boost people's \"mental health\" and he believed that had been achieved as he had \"not seen one face there not smiling, not happy and not chatting to their mates\". He decorated his tractor with lights and pulled along a trailer with a DJ, Father Christmas and an elf.Mr Hill said when he first had the idea, he thought only 20 or 30 tractors would take part. But \"every farm in Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire sent a tractor or two\" as well as other vehicles, he said.Mr Hill said he had the support of the National Farmers Union, local businesses and the council and just wanted to get people together.\"It was totally amazing. I can't thank everyone enough. Everyone has gone to town.\"Carla Pilsworth, from Garden House Hospice, said: \"It's absolutely incredible, just what the community needed.\" Photographer Roman Turney, from Hitchin, who captured the parade on camera, said: \"It was great to see all the vehicles covered in lights for a great cause.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook , Instagram and Twitter .
