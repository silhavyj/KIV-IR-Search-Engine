Richard Morris, 52, was last seen running in Alton, Hampshire, on 6 May. Officers want anyone who was jogging in the Holybourne area between 12:00 BST and 13:00 that day to get in touch. They have also appealed for dashcam footage from motorists driving between Holybourne and Binsted between the same times. The father of three was UK ambassador to Nepal for four years until 2019 and was recently appointed British High Commissioner to Fiji. Hampshire Constabulary said officers had searched more than nine sq km (3.5 sq miles) since Mr Morris disappeared, including at Alice Holt Forest and the River Wey. They have also scoured CCTV footage and carried out house-to-house inquiries in the area, the force added. Mr Morris, who is originally from Worcestershire, was last seen by a member of the public at about 10:30 BST on Isington Road, near his home in Bentley. He is white with a beard and greying hair and has a birthmark on his face. He was wearing a blue top, black shorts and blue trainers.
