The footbridge would linkYnysangharad War Memorial Park to the town centre. It would also connect the site of the former Taff Vale shopping centre whichis to be redeveloped under plans approved in September. Rhondda Cynon Taf council hopes that the new bridge would also boost business for Pontypridd shops. In a report to be discussed by councillors on Tuesday, Andrea Virgo, project team leader, said the new bridge would \"be a statement for the confidence in the future role of Pontypridd in the regional economy\". A business case for the new bridge and the Taff Vale development - which will include offices for Transport for Wales and Pontypridd library - is to be submitted to the council in the next few weeks. It is hoped a planning application for the bridge would then be submitted in 2018. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-42049494"}
