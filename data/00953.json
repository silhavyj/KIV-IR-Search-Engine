Ms Trump had accompanied her father US President Donald Trump on his first official visit to India last week. She had posted a picture of her on the marble bench in front of the monument, captioned: \"The grandeur and beauty of the Taj Mahal is awe inspiring.\"Dosanjh then tweeted the amended image - made by a fan - and tagged her. He wrote a Punjabi caption, which translated to: \"She was after me to take her to the Taj. I took her, because what else could I do?\" However, Ivanka Trump was not going to be outdone. She soon retweeted the picture with her own caption.She also retweeted various other memes people had made of her picture in front of the Taj, writing: \"I appreciate the warmth of the Indian people. ...I made many new friends!!!\" Dosanjh is well known for his social media persona, and often leaves humorous comments on the posts of international celebrities. He once tweeted at Kanye West, asking for a pair of his much coveted Yeezy 350 Boost sneakers. There is no evidence the singer ever saw the request.His Punjabi comments on Kylie Jenner's posts also have a separate fan following in India.He once even dedicated a love song to her, titled Do You Know.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51702180"}
