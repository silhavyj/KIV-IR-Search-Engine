One involved an eight-year-old girl who drifted out to sea on an inflatable in Kinmel Bay, Conwy county. HM Coastguard said it strongly urged people not to use inflatables at the coast. It comes as the weekend saw thehighest temperatures of the year , compared with the first half ofMay which had 157% of average monthly rainfall . Lifeguards in Wales said last week theywere expecting their busiest ever summer . Crews at Rhos Point, Conwy county, also responded to a call at about 15:30 after a man who had fallen from a water scooter could not get back onto it. Llandudno coastguard team and inshore lifeboat team went to help the man out of the water. On Anglesey, two kayakers - one of whom was in the water and unable to get back in - were helped by Treaddur Bay Lifeboat and Holyhead Coastguard teams. HM Coastguard said it had dealt with a \"myriad\" of other things including people getting cut off by the tide. It said it had been a \"busy\" day thanks to the sunny weather attracting visitors to the coast. Senior coastal operations officer, Michael Buratti, said: \"One of the incidents this afternoon attended by Rhyl coastguard rescue team and the RNLI inshore lifeboat from Rhyl involved a child on an inflatable that drifted out to sea at Kinmel Bay. \"People need to be aware that even the slightest offshore breeze can blow an inflatable out to sea very quickly. \"If the inflatable capsizes or the person on it panics and jumps into the water to swim to shore, the outcome could be devastating,\" he said.
