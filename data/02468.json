Earlier this year, the council said it wouldput together a \"people's bid\" , using the experience of individuals and community groups to bring together the town's best aspects. But a recent survey showed people were \"overwhelmingly against the idea\". The town failed in two previous attempts for city status. The survey of 700 residents of Swindon, a town with a population of more than 222,000 people, had \"71% signalling their opposition to the bid,\" the council told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service . The competition has been set up by the government to mark the Queen's 70th Jubilee next year. It was hoped city status could make Swindon more attractive for businesses wishing to relocate. But council leader David Renard said: \"It has been a difficult year for all of us, especially our businesses, due to the pandemic, and the responses from the recent survey indicate that pursuing city status is not the right thing to be doing at the present time.\"I completely understand the need to focus on the town's recovery and not be distracted by less important initiatives that will not provide a significant boost to the town's businesses.\" Swindon Borough Council made bids for city status when competitions were announced in 1999, to mark the change of Millennium, and in 2002 for the Queen's Golden Jubilee. Both times the town was unsuccessful.Follow BBC West on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
