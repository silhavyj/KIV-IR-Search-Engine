On Monday, Knight said the upcoming sixth series would be the last but teased that \"the story will continue in another form\". He has now confirmed to Deadline: \"My plan from the beginning was to end Peaky with a movie.\"This is what is going to happen,\" he added. He explained that \"Covid had changed our plans\" but did not elaborate. The final BBC TV series has resumed filming after being hit by Covid-related production delays. On Monday, Knight described the show as being \"back with a bang\" and warned fans that the mobsters would face \"extreme jeopardy\" in the sixth season. Knight had previously planned fora seven-season run of the drama, which is set in post-World War One Birmingham.\"My ambition is to make it a story of a family between two wars,\" he said in 2018 ahead of season five. \"I've wanted to end it with the first air raid siren in Birmingham in 1939.
