They were taken from Well Hall Lane in Ashwicken near King's Lynn, while another was removed from East End, High Street, in Thornham, near Hunstanton. Police said both featured the royal cypher \"GR\" which indicated they dated from the reign of George V (1910-36). Both postboxes were still in use, the force said. Officers also said the incidents could be linked to a third theft on 21 December, when a postbox was stolen from Thorpland Lane in Runcton Holme, near Downham Market. That one featured the royal cypher ER, dating from the reign of Elizabeth II (1952-present). Police want to hear from anyone who may have information about the thefts or the whereabouts of the stolen postboxes. Royal Mail described the theft of its postboxes as \"relatively rare\".\"However Royal Mail takes the issue very seriously,\" it added. The company said it used various preventative measures and technologies to deter theft, and worked with the police \"to prevent the unlawful removal of postboxes\". \"These measures include forensic tags, permanent metal marking systems and electronic tracking,\" a spokeswoman said. \"In the event that a crime is committed, these features can help our investigators to identify and trace stolen property as well as potential offenders.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook , Instagram and Twitter .
