Police said Dean Marriott pretended to scan areas around the home using a \"remote control\" before distracting the victim and taking the items. Officers identified the 52-year-old after CCTV captured him at the address in Aldgate Close, Bulwell, on 21 January. Marriott will be sentenced in February. Nottinghamshire Police said Marriott, of Wilkins Gardens, Clifton, was filmed outside the house looking through the kitchen window before the distraction burglary, and then again as he left the home. Marriott was chased by police after returning five hours later carrying the stolen iPhone 12. He claimed someone had told him to bring it back \"because it's all over Facebook\", the force said. Marriott admitted burglary at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Saturday. He will be sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court on 21 February. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , Twitter , or Instagram .
