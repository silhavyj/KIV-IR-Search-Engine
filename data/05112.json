The fire took hold in the end-of-terrace home in Sandford-on-Thames, near Oxford, at about 02:30 GMT. Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said the people living in the barn had left the property before crews arrived. No-one was hurt. A stretch of the A4074, which was closed both ways between the Heyford Hill and Golden Balls roundabouts, has since reopened. Fire crews were expected to remain on scene through Wednesday. The cause of the blaze will be investigated. Follow BBC South on Facebook , Twitter , or Instagram . Send your story ideas to south.newsonline@bbc.co.uk .
