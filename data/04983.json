Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) on the Central and Victoria lines will walk out for eight hours from 20:30 GMT on Friday and Saturday. Similar action is planned for every weekend until June. The union has accused Transport for London (TfL) of a \"deafening silence\" over the row, which TfL denies. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: \"The action continues tonight despite the fact that we believe there are simple and cost-free options that would enable us to consider suspending the action.\" He added that the \"issue at the heart of the dispute, protecting the work-life balance of drivers, cannot be swept under the carpet and needs to be addressed rather than dismissed\". A TfL spokesperson said: \"During the six months of regular [conciliation service] Acas talks on this matter, it's become clear that there are no new or workable proposals.\"However we remain in touch with both the RMT and Acas in the hope that a resolution can be found.\" Despite the strike action, TfL said a good Night Tube service is expected to run on the Victoria Line, while a regular service should run on the Central Line, with at least two trains per hour through central London.
