In 2008, Dave Heeley, from West Bromwich, became the first blind person to complete seven marathons in seven days on seven continents. National Express West Midlands said Pensnett garage staff named the bus \"to honour his amazing achievements\". It will go on the 120 service between Dudley and Birmingham via Oldbury. The company said when he was told of the naming, Mr Heeley \"thought it was a practical joke\" and did not believe it until the bus operator contacted him about launching the vehicle.Drivers at the Pensnett garage were given a vote to name 10 out of 21 new buses.Mr Heeley said: \"I am very proud and privileged to have been given this honour. I am so touched that the drivers at the National Express West Midlands Pensnett garage thought of me. \"I want to thank them for doing this - I can't wait to bring the kids down during the summer holiday to ride a bus named after their Dad!\" National Express West Midlands managing director Peter Coates said: \"Dave is an exceptional man whose achievements for charities are breathtaking.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-18683872"}
