The clip, posted on Instagram, also appeared to show the officer from West Midlands Police gesturing to the fan when he looked back. The force said it was aware of the footage which would be reviewed by its professional standards team. Police said the clip was shot after the Wolves v Arsenal fixture last Thursday. \"It comes after we tried to engage with a small number of fans suspected of being involved in anti-social behaviour,\" a spokesperson said. The six-second video had been watched thousands of times before being taken down on Tuesday afternoon. In the background of the footage, another man could be heard laughing after the incident, claiming of the officer: \"He's kicked him for no reason.\" The police spokesperson said: \"Our Professional Standards Department (PSD) are aware of the footage and will be conducting a review to establish the full context.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
