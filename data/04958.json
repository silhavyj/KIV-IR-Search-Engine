The marker at Battle Abbey had denoted the \"official\" location of the last Anglo-Saxon monarch's death, since the 1980s. But, a new study of the grounds show an area slightly to the east was where Harold fell, English Heritage said. Some historians dispute their account. Battle Abbey was founded by William the Conqueror on the site of 1066 battlefield, according to English Heritage.Historical accounts have claimed the abbey church, which was demolished in the 16th Century, had an altar where Harold fell. But, a new study of its layout showed the original was further east than first thought, English Heritage said. Roy Porter, from English Heritage, said: \"Working out the position of that altar was key and since the 19th century, our understanding of the layout of the church has improved dramatically.\" Author Nick Austin, who has previously advanced the theory that King Harold was defeated by William the Conqueror two miles away in Crowhurst, said he \"totally disagreed\" with moving the stone. \"The foundations haven't moved and the church hasn't moved,\" he said. \"New analysis of the Chronicle of Battle Abbey proves beyond doubt that the abbey was not the original battlefield. The site of the battle has been much-debated, with Mr Austin not the only historian to reject English Heritage's version of events. In December 2013, Channel 4's Time Team programme claimed Harold fell on the site of what is now amini roundabout on the A2100.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-36784485"}
