Sherwood MP Mark Spencer said it\"looks like I've been hacked\" after the picture was posted, along with an incomprehensible splurge of text. It is not known if any hackles were raised among Tories in Gedling, who are mentioned in the message. In what might have been a case of purr-fect timing, the tweet was sent on International Cat Day.
