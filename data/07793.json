Father Jamie McMorrin was praying at St Mary's Catholic Cathedral in York Place when he was attacked on Monday. The man asked if he was a priest and, when he replied that he was, the attacker tried to hit him on the head with the bottle. A spokesman for the Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh said it was \"a violent and unprovoked assault\".He said the 35-year-old priest was sitting alone when the man approached him. \"The bottle broke on the ground and the man continued using it in his assault,\" he added.\"The priest managed to fend him off with a chair before the attacker ran out of the cathedral. \"The priest escaped without injury.\" Deputy First Minister John Swinney tweeted to describe the bottle assault as \"a terrible, frightening and totally unacceptable incident\".A spokeswoman for Police Scotland confirmed they were called to a report of a 35-year-old man being assaulted. She added: \"Officers attended and the victim did not require hospital treatment. \"Inquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident and anyone with information is urged tocontact Police Scotland.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-57989939"}
