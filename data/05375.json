Mr Givan paid tribute to those involved in the redevelopment of the 29-acre site at Ebrington, which had been a military barracks until 2003. Ebrington's development is widely regarded as a key to Derry and the region's wider economic growth.\"As today's ideas become tomorrow's opportunities, I will be watching with interest as potential turns into reality for Londonderry,\" he said.
