The MP for Maidenhead said she was urging the Conservative-run Windsor and Maidenhead local authority to reconsider the decision.Norden Farm Centre for the Arts in Maidenhead said the money was \"absolutely essential\". Council leader Andrew Johnson previously said due to a tight budget it was ceasing all arts funding.

To lose that would be too tragic to imagine.\" It comes after the council cut the charity's funding by 45% last year.Arts centre The Old Court in Windsor also stands to lose all of its council funding.Jack Gamble, director of Public Campaign for the Arts, told BBC Radio Berkshire: \"The arts are not a luxury, they provide vital benefits to our lives and our communities. \"We do appreciate the financial pressures that councils are under... but sacrificing our cultural services are not the answer, we've got find a way to keep funding them alongside other services.\" Follow BBC South on Facebook , Twitter , or Instagram .
