Thecrash happened on Saturday at about 21:30 GMT on the A548 in Pensarn near Abergele, killing 63-year-old Ieuan Richard Williams from Pensarn. His daughter Elize said she hoped there was a kebab shop and a pint waiting for her dad, who she would always love. Three people have been arrested as part of the investigation. The tribute said: \"Dad - I hold so many fond memories, memories that make me smile and some that make me frown, but you will always live on for as long as I live.\"Hopefully there is a kebab shop up there for you and a decent pint.\"There are a lot of your traits instilled in me but the 'stone faced' look comes in handy from time to time so cheers for that.\"I love you so much and I will never forget you (or your 'baldy head and funny teeth' - well, lack of them as we used to say).\" North Wales Police are continuing to appeal for witnesses into the collision which also involved a black BMW car.
