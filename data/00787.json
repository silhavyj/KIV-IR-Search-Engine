Speakers called for a windfall tax on energy companies amid concerns over rising energy and food bills. Stella Kennedy, who took part in the protest in Bangor, Gwynedd, said it was \"insane how much more this crisis is going to affect ordinary people, especially those on low incomes\". Oil giant BP said awindfall tax would cut investment in UK gas and renewables. Jessica Kleczka, who also took part in the protest, said: \"There needs to be a windfall tax on oil and gas companies. \"It's unacceptable that they are making such huge profits at a time when so many people are struggling with their living costs,\" she said. Graduate Edryd Gwyfyn lives with family and thought it would not be \"sustainable\" to move out. \"A third of Welsh families are already struggling with their bills, and a lot... are already struggling to put food on the table for their children,\" they said. \"It's awful that the government is so out of touch that they think a 54% increase, and a tiny amount of money to help with that, will help.\" Unite's Christine Hardacre dubbed the energy cost rises \"ridiculous and unnecessary\".\"It's time we actually took back ownership of our utility industries and make sure that people are put before profit,\" she said. \"People just can't afford this. It's going to have a massive impact. \"Wales is one of the poorest parts of the United Kingdom, it's going to hit Wales really, really hard.\" Oil giant Shell reported massive profits on the same day the energy regulator Ofgem announced UK householders would see a 54% rise in domestic energy bills from April,costing about \u00a3693 extra a year .
