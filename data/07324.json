The dead whale was spotted on Wednesday before its body came ashore close to Scrabster, near Thurso, on Thursday morning. The Inverness-based Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme said it was preparing to investigate the animal's death. It is the latest incident of its kind in about a month. A minke whale was found dead in Barra earlier this month, and humpback in Fife in April. Both were tangled in rope. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-48458440"}
