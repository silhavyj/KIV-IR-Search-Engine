British Transport Police said the collapse at Northwich station in Cheshire happened at about 11:50 BST. The force said there were not believed to be any injuries as a result of the collapse, but it had left a pile of rubble on one of the platforms. Network Rail said the station would be shut until 18:00 on Wednesday due to debris blocking the line.\"We're working with Cheshire Fire and Rescue service after a partial building collapse at Northwich station,\" a spokesman said, adding that \"fortunately, no-one has been injured\".He said it was \"too early to say what caused this\", but investigations were \"under way and the station is closed\".Services between Manchester Piccadilly and Chester have since restarted but trains are not expected to call at Northwich until Wednesday evening, he said. He apologised to passengers affected and advised people travelling in the area to check National Rail Enquiries before they make their journey, adding some bus replacement services were in place. Weaver Vale MP Mike Amesbury said he would be speaking to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps \"as a matter of urgency\" about what had happened, but the priority was \"to make the area safe and get the trains running again\".
