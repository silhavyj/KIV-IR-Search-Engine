Skidby Mill, near Skidby, East Yorkshire, is to close on Monday for a couple of weeks. The mill's sails are already being renovated and distinctive wooden arms have already been taken down. The East Riding of Yorkshire Council said the closure would improve facilities for both \"visitors and our staff who are based there\". A firm of professional millwrights are undertaking the work and removed the sails to prevent any damage to the Grade II* listed works. No date has been given for completion of all the work but it is designed to help the \"sustainable running\" of the heritage site that was initially restored in 1974. Unusual to most surviving mills, Skidby still has all of its original outbuildings around the courtyard, said the council. The complex also contains a museum of rural life, garden and cafe and is owned by the council. The mill's buildings are due to reopen on Saturday 5 February, the council said.
