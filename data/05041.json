Thames Valley Police said the officer's behaviour did not stop even after he was warned by his superiors.The hearing was held in private and his identity will not be revealed because of worries over his health.It took place on 8 November but the panel's findings were published on Thames Valley Police's website forthe first time on Tuesday .The panel said he had shown a \"lack of respect\" for the women, and said a \"high level of harm\" had been caused by his actions.Its members found his conduct \"fell far below the standards expected of any police officer and especially of one of his rank and years of service\".It found the officer, who resigned before the panel took place, had undertaken \"deliberate and clearly targeted\" behaviour with \"malign intent\".The panel's members found he would have been sacked without notice had he not already resigned.
