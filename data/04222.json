The poor weather from Storm Jorge comes after flooding caused by storms Ciara and Dennis earlier in February.Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan said the authority took hundreds of calls overnight from residents about culverts overflowing and water flowing through Pontypridd streets. He said the River Taff \"was a very close call\" when it reached its peak but it dropped nine inches by Saturday morning. Meanwhile in Cardiff, South Wales Police closed Ely Bridge on Cowbridge Road for two hours during the night due to the high river. Jason Evans, from South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said it received 72 calls overnight but added: \"Luckily, the weather was on our side and we didn't need to evacuate properties in these areas.\" Rhondda Cynon Taf council said engineers were monitoring a landslip in Wattstown, adding: \"There's no reason for public concern at this time.\" It asked the public to stay clear of the hillside until the situation is resolved.Separately, a landslide shut off access to the village of Pontsticill which Merthyr Tydfil council worked to clear on Saturday.

In a joint statement with Chris Pearce, Network Rail's Head of Operations for Wales and the Borders, she added: \"From Saturday afternoon we're expecting very stormy conditions and high winds that have the potential to uproot trees and damage infrastructure, so there will be speed restrictions on certain lines on our network.\" In north Wales, Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog remains closed following damage caused by Storm Ciara.Some ferry services from west Wales to Rosslare were also cancelled ahead of the winds moving in. The weather has also led to the postponement of Sunday'sSt David's Day Run due to flooding at Cardiff's Bute Park , according to organisers.
