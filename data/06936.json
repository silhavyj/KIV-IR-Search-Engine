E-scooters are legally classed as a motor vehicle and cannot be used on public paths or roads unless they are part of a government trial. South Wales Police said Cardiff Bay and Penarth are not part of that trial, and people are inadvertently breaking the law which can lead to points on a licence. The force said teams will continue to educate users, and enforce when needed. \"We're aware that those planning to use e-scooters are purchasing them in the mistaken belief they can legally use them on public paths and roads,\" a police statement said. \"This is not the case and people are inadvertently breaking the law in this way.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-59034573"}
