Keyron Curtis, 21, from Cwmdare, died from a \"catastrophic head injury\" outside the Colliers Arms in Penywaun, Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, on 17 October. Daniel Howells-Thomas, 24, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and assaulting another man at Newport Crown Court. Mr Curtis had a \"heart of gold\" and \"would have been a great dad\", his family said.They added: \"He was loved by us all, and always put other people before himself. \"He will be sorely missed by all of his family and friends.\" Police said witnesses told them Mr Curtis was punched with such force he immediately lost consciousness before hitting his head on a kerb. He died in hospital from his injuries the following day after friends administered CPR following his cardiac arrest outside the pub. Det Insp Dai Butt said: \"This was a cowardly attack on a man who was in no way able to defend himself. \"The actions by the defendant were deplorable - he went out that evening to celebrate a football win with his team mates but went home in the early hours a killer. \"A single punch has devastated the lives of many people. Howells-Thomas, of Penywaun, will be sentenced on 10 December. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-59336928"}
