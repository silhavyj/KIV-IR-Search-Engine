The closure wasput in place on Friday as part of a \"firebreak\" to help stem the spread of the virus. Plans to provide a service for the children of \"critical\" workers would be put in place from Tuesday, Howard Quayle said. Details of that provision are due to be released later. Mr Quayle said places would only be available to the children of essential workers \"whose roles are critical to the protection of life or infrastructure\". Education Minister Alex Allinson said the Council of Ministers would \"continue working on the detail\" of those plans on Sunday to ensure that \"schools will remain a safe place for those that need to use them\". In the meantime, the children of essential workers can be looked after by other family members, although they should be prevented from mixing with children from other households wherever possible, a government spokesman said.
