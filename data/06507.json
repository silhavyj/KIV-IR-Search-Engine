Work to strengthen Pontypridd's 148-year-old Victoria Bridge over the River Taff starts on Saturday and will take 27 weeks. Vehicles travelling from the A470 across the bridge into the town centre will be unaffected. All other routes will be diverted and some bus routes will be affected . Victoria Bridge carries the A4223 over the river and is one of the main routes linking Pontypridd and the Rhondda Valleys to the A470. The work will involve demolishing the structures that support the bridge footway and installing a new bridge deck. Pedestrian access will be unaffected but some overnight and weekend closures will be carried out and will be advertised in advance.
