Rhondda Cynon Taf council is promising a \"transformation\" of its streets with new granite paving, benches, lighting and litter bins. The two-year project has begun starting in Mill Street, before including Taff Street, High Street and other parts of the town. Each section is likely to take up to six months to complete. The council admits the town looks \"outdated\", and said the new street furniture would be \"of a quality fitting for a 21st Century town centre\". Paul Cannon, the cabinet member for economic development, said: \"Once again it illustrates our commitment to ensure that the Pontypridd town centre regeneration project will have a positive impact on this important visitor destination.\" The council said every effort would be made to \"maintain safe access to the shops and business premises as the work progresses\".Work on a separate scheme by developers Taff Vale Limited, where a new shopping complex will replace the rundown Taff Vale centre, is due to start in the spring.
