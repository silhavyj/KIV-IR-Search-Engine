The authority's share of the bills will increase from \u00a31,340.91 to \u00a31,401.12 from April 2022 for Band D homes. Other precepting authorities - including individual district councils and the police and fire services - have yet to decide on changes. The Conservative-run county council says the increase of 4.49% is below the current rate of inflation. The increase is made up of a 2.99% council tax increase and 1.5% for adult social care that was deferred from last year during the pandemic, reports theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. The council says inflation has added \u00a332m to next year's bill for services, with interest rate rises increasing the cost of borrowing for the council's capital spending programme. It plans to spend \u00a3284m in 2022-23 on major infrastructure projects, such as new schools and large road improvements. Demand for council services which protect the most vulnerable has also risen - particularly in adult social care, it said. Kevin Bentley, leader of Essex County Council, said: \"We are responsible for ensuring that we renew our economy, provide equal opportunities for all and ignite ambition for the people and places we are privileged to represent. \"This budget is a crucial step on that journey.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook , Instagram and Twitter .
