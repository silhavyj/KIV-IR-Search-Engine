National Highways first reported there had been a serious incident just before 07:15 GMT on Friday. The northbound side was closed first, before a decision was made to shut the road southbound - between the B6325 for North Muskham and the A57 for Worksop. The roads agency confirmed the road had fully reopened after clearance work just before 14:30. The southbound side reopened first but the northbound section remained closed while police investigations were carried out, National Highways added. The closure caused significant disruption during morning rush hours and there may be some residual disruption for a time. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , Twitter , or Instagram .
