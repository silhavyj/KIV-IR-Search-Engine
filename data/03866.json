South Wales and Mid and Wales Fire Services sent 14 appliances and seven officers to Capital Valley Plastics, in Blaenavon, at about 21:40 BST on Saturday. Neighbouring properties were advised to keep doors and windows closed due to a \"large smoke plume\" from the fire. Two fire engines and a high volume pump have now scaled it down. The fire, which was \"well-alight\", left no-one injured, a spokeswoman said. Travel disruptions in the area are expected after Gwent Police closed the road to allow crews to deal with the incident.
