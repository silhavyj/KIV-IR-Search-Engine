Bristol's Gloucester Road is famous for its long strip of independent businesses which include greengrocers, butchers and toy shops. The Shop Local Gloucester Road Facebook group was set up by mum Alice Darley and has become a \"lifeline\". One business owner said the group has boosted her shop during lockdown. Miss Darley opened the Facebook group to allow others to order items from the shops that didn\u2019t already have an online service. \"When lockdown came it became clear that there must be another way to shop locally,\" she said. \u201cIt's been a lifeline for traders and the community.\u201d Laura Sharp, assistant manager of zero-waste shop Preserve, said: \u201cOur customers feel more comfortable shopping here than large supermarkets during the pandemic because it feels safer. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more customers during lockdown because of the Facebook group. \u201cIt also definitely brings Gloucester Road together as a community.\u201dAmy Osborne, the manager of Dave Giles Butchers which has been trading on Gloucester Road for 30 years, said the group had become essential to the strip of businesses. She said: \u201cThe Facebook group is becoming a lifeline for a lot of independent business here during the lockdown. \u201cFor a lot of businesses here this lockdown is going to be difficult so the Facebook group is important.\u201d Bristol wine shop Grape and Grind\u2019s owner, Daren Willis, closed his shop temporarily in March. He said: \u201cWe were able to tick along online and on Facebook whilst the shutters were down. \u201cThe support for Gloucester Road is extraordinary.\" Follow BBC West on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
