The extra security also aims at halting the torching of cars that often takes place on the final night of the year.France has confirmed 2.6m Covid-19 cases, the fifth highest total in the world, and more than 64,000 deaths. Like other European countries, France will see muted celebrations for New Year's Eve amid the pandemic.In her New Year address, German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke emotionally about the pandemic which had \"imposed a lot on everyone, and too much on some\" in 2020. She reached out to those who had lost loved ones to Covid-19, and she attacked coronavirus conspiracy theories, \"which are not just false and dangerous, but also cynical and cruel towards those people\". French Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin has ordered a visible security presence in city centres and flashpoint suburbs from 20:00 (19:00 GMT), when the curfew begins. In Paris half of the metro lines will be closed in the evening, while Mr Darmanin also asked for a wider public transport shutdown across the country to be considered. Despite rising cases,and concerns over a new more contagious strain of the disease, a government spokesman said there was no need for local lockdowns for now. France has had two national lockdowns and bars, restaurants and cultural attractions will remain closed into January. Mr Darmanin has written to regional leaders informing them of Thursday's \"exceptional\" mobilisation of 100,000 police and gendarmes. Officers will be instructed to break up underground parties as soon as they are reported, fine participants and identify the organisers. Patrols meanwhile are to carry out \"appropriate identity checks\" and search vehicles. Mr Darmanin also urged shops to limit or stop the sale of flammable liquids in portable containers and takeaway alcoholic drinks. He has also suggested that local authorities do not publicise incidents of cars set alight, to \"avoid any incidence of 'competition'\" between different areas. Car burning has effectively become an annual event in French suburbs since riots in 2005 in Paris and elsewhere. Last year a record 1,457 cars were torched across France on New Year's Eve, according to media reports. The previous year's figure was 1,290.
