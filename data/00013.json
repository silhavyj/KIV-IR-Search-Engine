The Great Mormon was discovered at Butterfly World in St Albans. The sex division occurs straight down the middle of the abdomen and is visible in the different wing patterns, with the female half on the right. Butterfly World said this natural phenomenon occurred in only one in 10,000, or 0.01% of butterflies.A lepidopterist at the centre, Louise Hawkins, said the phenomenon happens \"very early on\" in the development of a butterfly when the \"sex chromosomes don't divide properly\". It makes the creature infertile and they generally tend to have a shorter life span as their internal organs will be \"a bit mixed up\". \"It is fascinating to look at,\" she said. \"Members of staff keep popping into my office to look at it as no one can quite believe that nature can create something so neat.\" The centre said it hopes to have the butterfly on display over the next few days.
