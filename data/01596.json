There will be a speed limit of 9mph instead of the usual 15mph from 18:00, and riders will also be prevented from parking in parts of the city centre. This is in addition to a curfew on overnight use already in operation. It is hoped the measures, which will run until Monday, will stop people hiring them after nights out. The electric vehicles will be prevented from parking in areas including around Central Station, Monument, Haymarket, Cathedral Square, Dean Street, and up to St James' Boulevard. Operator Neuron announced it will also bring in additional safety ambassadors in the city centre, theLocal Democracy Reporting Service said. The e-scooters have have proved a controversial addition to Newcastle since arriving in February, withreports they were being misused and last month six peoplewere banned from the roads after being caught drink-riding them . Neuron said: \"With the much-awaited return of pubs and other entertainment venues in the city centre, Neuron and Newcastle City Council are keen to ensure that the e-scooters aren't seen as an option for overly-exuberant revellers.\" The company's city manager, Chris Miles, added: \"Now is the time to be enjoying new-found freedom rather than risking points on your licence or spending time in A&E.\" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram .
