Liam McElhinney was shot in the leg at his grandmother's home in Springhill Park at about 19:20 GMT on Wednesday evening. He was also beaten with a baseball bat. His grandmother Jessie Powell said the two masked men who entered her home also put a gun to his young brother's face. She told BBC News NI the family have been left traumatised by the attack. \"How dare they come - I am an old age pensioner - to my home and do that? They have no respect. We are going to live in fear now every night. \"If you are going to target an 11-year-old child, put a gun to an 11-year-old's face and steal his phone, what kind of people are they?\" She said her older grandson was \"still very bad in hospital\". SDLP councillor Jason Barr described the incident as \"extremely worrying\". \"This attack was carried out by armed and masked men in a residential area in the early evening, it was very sinister and will cause concern in the local community. \"There is no place for weapons on our streets and I hope those behind this attack will be apprehended as soon as possible.\" Police have appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
