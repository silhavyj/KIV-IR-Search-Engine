Melissa Denman, 26, attacked the male officer on Thursday night on Alfreton Road, Nottingham, police said. The officer was not seriously hurt, the force added. Denman was given a 16-week suspended jail sentence at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Saturday for common assault of an emergency worker. Denman, of Waterford Street in Nottingham, pleaded guilty to the offence along with another charge of being drunk and disorderly. In addition to the sentence, suspended for 18 months, Denman was ordered to pay \u00a3100 compensation, a \u00a3128 victim surcharge and \u00a385 costs. Det Insp Marcus Oldroyd, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: \"Officers go to work every day with one goal in mind - to keep the public safe from harm. \"Any form of physical attack on them is entirely unacceptable. \"Her behaviour on this occasion was appalling.\" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on Twitter , or on Instagram .
