They talked about the best ways to try to save water after one of the driest springs on record. Nearly 100 farmers in Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire and Norfolk have been told to stop watering crops from rivers. Parts of south-west and south-east England, the Midlands and Wales are also experiencing near-drought conditions. Newsbeat asked people in Northamptonshire how the drought was affecting them. \"It's been nice not to get wet all the time at work, out on roofs. \"I've not heard about this drought. \"Even if there is a hosepipe ban, I pay to have my car washed, so it doesn't affect me.\" \"It's been quite hot and we've had quite a few barbies and sessions. \"I don't use a hosepipe, so it doesn't really bother me. \"I'm hoping the summer is like the spring.\" \"I probably wouldn't think twice about it. \"I don't do gardening, I get someone to do it for me. I'm a typical woman.\" Stuart said: \"I can't remember the last time we had a good rainfall. \"I like the hot weather, but we try to keep the little one out of the sun, but she won't keep her hat on.\" Carrie said: \"Drought will affect the price of the food and the farmers won't have any choice. \"They lose money, it costs us more money.\"My granddad was farm worker. It's not just arable, but cattle and milk products too.\"We might not notice it now but it does affect us all and the price of things will go up.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-13731329"}
