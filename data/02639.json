Tens of thousands of drivers will be affected by the changes, which include charging private cars to drive through much of the city centre.The CAZ was due to be launched inOctober this year but has suffered a number of delays. Bristol City Council said there will be millions of pounds of government support available to help people adapt.The city has beenunder pressure from the government to reduce pollution to within legal limits by 2023.Bristol mayor Marvin Rees confirmed the scheme has now received the backing of the government.

Polluting private cars, taxis and vans will be charged \u00a39 a day to enter the zone, while polluting buses, coaches and lorries will be charged \u00a3100 a day, according to the plans submitted to the Government in February of this year. The charges will not apply to petrol vehicles that meet Euro 4, 5 and 6 emission standards (those dating from roughly 2006 onwards) or to Euro 6 diesel vehicles (those roughly from the end of 2015 onwards).

The authority said it will help people switch to greener modes of transport using \u00a342m of government funding.
