The station has announced the line-up for its third Christmas takeover.It will showcase 30 new and emerging DJs and presenters between Boxing Day and New Year's Day. Head of Radio 1 Aled Haydn Jones says the takeover \"has grown into a powerful catalyst for boosting the careers of new and emerging presenters and DJs\". The guest presenters will take over shows from familiar Radio 1 names during the Christmas period. Some of those taking to the airwaves have taken an unconventional route to their first slot on Radio 1, including Alex Woolhouse, who trained as a solicitor before a career change into broadcasting.\"I always listened to Radio 1 growing up so it's absolutely amazing,\" Alex told Newsbeat.\"This is definitely the biggest thing I've done,\" added the 25-year-old, who described it as an \"amazing moment\" to be presenting as a trans woman.Alex will co-host Radio 1's Life Hacks with Carrie Morrison, an \"autistic and proud\" podcast producer from Worthing.Ren\u00e9 LaVice's Drum & Bass Show will be covered by Sweetpea - an NHS worker by day and DJ by night.\"I am so gassed - it's so surreal,\" she says. \"I'm renaming it the D&Pea show and expect nothing less than the full 360.\"The line-up also includes professional skateboarder James Threlfall, who will be presenting Radio 1's Dance Anthems. James was awarded an MBE in 2019 for charity work supporting disadvantaged young people. \"Getting on BBC Radio 1 has been a real dream for me. I can't wait to bring all the energy and amazing tunes to New Year's Day,\" he says.
