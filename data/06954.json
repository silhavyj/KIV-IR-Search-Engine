Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels on Hafodyrynys Road, near Crumlin, Caerphilly county, have been the highest in the UK outside central London. Caerphilly council bought the 23 homes after price agreements with the owners. The work had been due to begin in May but the council said ithad to be postponed twice due to the pandemic. The site was prepared for demolition to start after gas supplies were removed. Martin Brown, who lived at Woodside Terrace on Hafodyrynys Road for 50 years, said: \"My wife Patricia's crying her eyes out at home but I'm happy it's finally happening.\"The houses might be going, but we've got memories of our time here, good and bad. \"But they did need to come down.\" Hafodyrynys Road was named the UK's most polluted street outside central London in 2016 due to recorded nitrogen dioxide levels. Pollution gets trapped between the houses and trees opposite from vehicles travelling between Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent and parts of Caerphilly county.The purchase of the properties was agreed by the council's cabinet in 2019. \"It's been a long time coming and it's been a difficult process to get here but we need to improve air quality in the area, and this is the best way to do that,\" said Philippa Marsden, leader of Caerphilly council.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-58898189"}
