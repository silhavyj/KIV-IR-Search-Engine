Southampton City Council will discuss the outline application by developer Sovereign Centros early next year. John Marsh, a director at the firm, said the scheme would bring \"significant investment\" to Southampton and would create a \"vibrant environment alongside the waterfront\". He said the plans, which include restaurants, shops, a multi-storey car park and office space, would create 1,000 jobs. The firm said it hoped the development would be built in four stages from 2022 after a more detailed planning application is submitted. The site forms part of the city's so-called Mayflower Quarter, between the central railway station and the Mayflower Park, which is earmarked for redevelopment by the council.
