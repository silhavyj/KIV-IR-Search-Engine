The video was made by The Wave House, a collective of six social media influencers who live in a mansion together. It failed to make clear the post was \u201ca marketing communication\u201d, the ASA said. The Wave House told the ASA the ad was posted in error without the required label and was removed. It did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. In the video, two women wear embroidered pink jackets which say \u201cPretty Little Thing\u201d. The brand was also tagged in the post. Two men are also in the video, posing in convertible cars and wearing leather jackets at the mansion. \u201cWho do you think won this race? @prettylittlething #grease #fyp,\u201d the description said. The regulator argued that the post should have contained the hashtag #ad or a similar disclaimer label. Pretty Little Thing told the ASA their contractual agreement with The Wave House \u201cexpressly stated that all social media posts in connection with the agreement were obviously identifiable as an ad by using the #ad disclosure.\u201d \u201cWe considered that there was nothing in the content of the TikTok post... that made clear to consumers that it was an ad,\u201d the ASA judgement said. \u201cWe therefore concluded that the post was not obviously identifiable as a marketing communication and as such breached the code.\u201d The ad has been banned and any future advertisements must have identifiers such as #ad \u201cclearly and prominently displayed,\u201d it said.
