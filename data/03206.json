Nicholas Saunders was head of Cwmcarn Primary School from 2014 to 2019.A fitness-to-practise panel found him guilty of unacceptable professional conduct, including shouting at the child and removing his ear defenders from behind. The panel found six allegations proved.The Education Workforce Council (EWC) hearing had previously been told on 31 January 2019 he had shouted at and grabbed a seven or eight-year-old boy who was being assessed at the time for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Three members of staff told the hearing Mr Saunders' actions were \"angry\", \"out of control\" and \"unnecessary\", with one saying it was out of character for the head teacher. The boy was on the additional learning needs register and was known to staff as having trigger points that could make him tense or distressed. He has subsequently been diagnosed with ASD. Former class teacher Peter de Snyder and learning support assistant Helen Manning said the boy, referred to as Pupil A, was known for having outbursts and the usual way to deal with them was to give him space, while staying nearby, to give him a chance to calm down. Mr Saunders, who was not present at the hearing, said in a letter read out at the hearing he had already been punished, having lost the use of his qualification, his job and any way of earning a living in education. He said he had loved the school and only wished he had been listened to. He denied being aggressive or attempting to restrain the child. Mr Saunders will not be able to apply for restoration on to the EWC register for a minimum of two years. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-57734609"}
