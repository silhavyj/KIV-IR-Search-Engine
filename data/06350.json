Savannah Brockhill, 28, wasjailed for 25 years for murder after a court heard how she abused Star before her death in 2020. Star's 20-year-old mother, Frankie Smith, was jailed for eight years. She was found to have caused or allowed her daughter's death alongside Brockhill. Speaking at the Sunday evening Roberts Park gathering, Anita Smith said: \"I know none of you will never ever forget her. \"I know that. We won't. \"I want to thank each and everyone for coming and remembering Star.\" Anita Smith was one of five family members and friends to make areferral to social services before the toddler's death from \"catastrophic\" injuries in Bradford on 22 September 2020. Following the community gathering, Star's aunt, Alicia Szepler said the support of \"so many people is overwhelming\". \"It's always emotional when it comes to Star, especially when they play her songs. \"Music makes me feel closest to her.\" Before the vigil, a Santa's sleigh, complete with a star, was driven on streets around the family's home in Baildon. \"It was beautiful,\" said Ms Szepler. Bradford Council has said a Child Safeguarding Practice Review into the case would be published next month.
