The \u00a31.3m project at the hospital in Bishop's Castle has seen improvements carried out in two phases which were completed late last year. It will be run by the Community Health NHS Trust which has recently been approved by the Department of Health. Community services run by Shropshire and Telford Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) are to move to the new body. Jo Chambers, chief executive designate of the Community Health NHS Trust, said: \"The refurbishment of Bishop's Castle Hospital has been a great example of the positive benefits that can be achieved for patients when local communities and the NHS work closely together, and I'd like to thank everyone who has been part of the project.\"The new Community NHS Trust will be very keen to keep up this same style of partnership working with communities, GPs and other NHS Trusts.\"The new trust will take control from July, a spokesman added. Up to \u00a3750,000 for the refurbishment has come from Shropshire County PCT and the rest from other sources, such as the hospital's Friends and the government-backed King's Fund.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-shropshire-13055062"}
