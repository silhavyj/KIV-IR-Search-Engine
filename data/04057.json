Russia's health ministry said 14 miners were taken to hospital, including three with severe injuries.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered officials to provide assistance and investigate the reasons behind the accident, his spokesman has said.Several small cabins, where workers are thought to have lived, were swept away by the flood waters, the Interfax news agency reported.
