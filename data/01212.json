AGR 4 Solar Limited wants to build an 88-hectare (0.8 sq km) solar farm near three villages in Hertfordshire. Thirteen objections have already been raised, including one describing it as \"environmental vandalism\". The applicant said the proposed solar farm would contribute to the government target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Following the submission of the plans to North Hertfordshire Council on 14 December, residents raised concerns that the development would \"create a blight on our landscape\" in the villages of Great Wymondley, Graveley and Little Wymondley. Another said it could make \"driving to Great Wymondley from Graveley like driving through a demilitarised zone\", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service . The scheme would include around 150,000 solar panels, as well as 22 transformer stations and 22 battery storage containers. It would have an operational life of up to 40 years before it would be decommissioned, and the land would then be returned to agricultural use. In a statement submitted to the council, AGR 4 Solar Limited argued the benefits of the scheme would outweigh any concerns about the green belt. \"If North Hertfordshire are serious about their commitment to tackling the climate change emergency action is required now to dramatically alter the current path of future greenhouse gas emissions within the district and nationally,\" it said.
