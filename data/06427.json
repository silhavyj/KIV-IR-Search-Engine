It is not yet known if Odeon will relocate elsewhere in the city and if jobs will be lost as a result of the imminent closure.But in a statement Odeon said negotiations were underway with the developers and landlord \"to secure a cinema premises again\" once the redevelopment is completed. The Leisure World site first opened in 1997, but will be demolished under the plans tabled by developer Sovereign Centros.Work on the \u00a3250m home and leisure scheme is set to start in early 2023.
