Rhondda Cynon Taf council said it was also working to reopen the venue. \"Some of you have been in touch, worried at reports that the Muni has closed,\" Mr Smith, Labour MP for Pontypridd, said. \"I want to reassure you all that this will be temporary and plans are already in hand to reopen at the earliest possible opportunity.\" Mr Smith said that the company running the Muni had had \"longstanding problems\", including with \"poor governance\". A spokesperson for Rhondda Cynon Taf council revealed it had \"provided some short-term relief\" to the company in November.

The spokesperson added: \"Given the importance of the Muni in Pontypridd, the council recognises the need to come to a new arrangement at the earliest possible opportunity and is already engaging with interested parties to ensure that the facility is able to reopen at the earliest possible opportunity.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-46672206"}
