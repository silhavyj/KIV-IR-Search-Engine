Publisher Activision revealed the game had its own \u201cinternal anti-cheat software\u201d, which it was now enhancing following demands from players. Several high-profile streamers had criticised the battle-royal game for being \u201csaturated with hackers\u201d. More than 300,000 permanent bans had been issued since the game\u2019s release, last March, Activision said. Other popular games such as Fortnite and Fall Guys outsource their anti-cheat code. \u201cWe are committed to delivering a fair and fun experience for all players,\u201d Activisionsaid in a blog post. \u201cThis is a dedicated focus for our security, enforcement and technology teams.\u201d It comes after UK-based Vikkstar - whose real name is Vikram Singh Barn - announced he was quitting Warzone because of its cheating problem. \u201cThis needs to be fixed,\u201d he told his seven million subscribers. \"Otherwise, it truly will be the death of the game.\" Vikkstar has now welcomed Activision's latest announcement as \u201ca step in the right direction\". \u201cHoping the new resources dedicated to monitoring and enforcement pay off,\u201d he added in a tweet. Activision confirmed to the BBC that its anti-cheat has been in place in the game's launch but that it will be making significant investment to improve the software. The firm also emphasised other preventative measures in place on Warzone, including: \"There\u2019s no place for cheating,\u201d the statement added.\u201cWe are listening and will not stop in our efforts.\u201d But, as there was little detail on how the anti-cheat software worked, it was difficult to tell how effective it would be, Sam Connolly, at the University of Central Lancashire, said. \u201cPromising weekly security updates does instil confidence,\" he said. \"And updates to the anti-cheat are certainly an effective way to eliminate large numbers of hackers from the game. \u201cHowever, a large number of these changes suggested by Activision do rely on players reporting hackers and then another person to review the evidence.\u201cThis is typically not as fast as an automated anti-cheat process. \"And therefore we can expect that this situation isn\u2019t likely to change as quickly as some players may hope.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55919196"}
