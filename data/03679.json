The 18-year-old was returning from his successful driving test when officers in the town of Hemer checked his car with a laser speed gun. He was clocked travelling almost twice the speed limit - at 95km/h (60mph) in a 50km/h (30mph) zone. \"Some things last for ever - others not for an hour,\" German police wrote in their statement. The young man had four friends in the car with him, regional police in M\u00e4rkischer Kreis said - and speculated that perhaps he was trying to impress with his driving skills. Instead, he now faces a hefty punishment. He has been formally banned for four weeks, but police said he would only get his licence back after \"expensive retraining\". He is also facing a \u20ac200 fine, two points on his licence once it is restored, and his probationary period as a new driver has been lengthened from two years to four.
