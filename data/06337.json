The waste, which includes soft toys, plastic bags and photographs, was discovered by the charity that operates Telford Steam Railway. The rubbish on the Network Rail-owned site, near the A4169 near Horsehay, was first discovered in December. The firm said the clean-up, which will cost about \u00a340,000, is expected to finish on Wednesday.

Mr Edge said the contractors would be using grab lorries to remove the litter. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-shropshire-39484748"}
