They were considering proposals to demand EU-backed status for the shellfood - similar to that which protects foods such as Cornish pasties. But fishermen and processors voted against the move by 45 votes to six. Fishermans' leader John Lee said most thought the geographical area where the crabs could be caught would be \"too difficult to define\". He also said there was concern about the financial costs associated with monitoring and verifying produce. Fishermen were consulted in Wells-next-the-Sea, Sheringham, Cromer and Mundesley. Cromer crabs have been a delicacy on the north Norfolk coast for centuries, being known for their sweet taste.Foods around the country to have protected name status include the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie and Cornish Clotted Cream.
