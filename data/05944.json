Sgt Jon Harris shocked pub-goers at Glasgow's Waterloo bar on Wednesday nightwith his version of the classic 1978 hit . He had been called out to an alleged assault and took the mic after he and fellow officers arrested a man. Gloria Gaynor retweeted the story, saying \"I love this!\" She added: \"Sgt Jon Harris sang #iwillsurvive to smooth tensions in Glasgow pub after a brawl\". Sgt Harris was in full uniform at the time. The video of his arresting performance has since gone viral on social media. Peter McKenna-Boyd,who filmed the performance , said: \"Everybody just loved it\". He told BBC Radio Scotland's The Kaye Adams programme: \"Nobody expected it to happen. Everybody was clapping and cheering for him. \"He was hilarious, especially his pointing and his dance moves. The other policemen were standing and clapping and cheering. Not sure if he was their boss but when they first saw him it was like their dad had just got up on the karaoke.\" Ch Insp Mark Sutherland, of Police Scotland, said the sergeant's performance helped to defuse any simmering tensions in the pub.\"I was pleased to see that once the incident had been professionally concluded, my officers were able to share a lighter moment with those who remained in the pub,\" he added.
