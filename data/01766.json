It hasalready been running in 60 schools in Newry and south Down since September 2021.The scheme has beenin operation in police forces in England and Wales for a number of years. Operation Encompass aims to help children affected by domestic violence by getting them immediate support from staff in their school. If the PSNI is called to an incident and a child is present, they will inform school staff responsible for safeguarding before the start of the next school day.

Details of the extension of the scheme in schools in Northern Ireland was revealed by Education Minister Michelle McIlveen, in response to an assembly question from Sinn F\u00e9in MLA Linda Dillon. The minister also said that 51 referrals had been received by schools from the PSNI of incidents involving 106 pupils since the pilot scheme in the Downpatrick PSNI area began in September. \"Stage two of the pilot scheme is due to start in February 2022 and will add a further 77 schools,\" Ms McIlveen said.
