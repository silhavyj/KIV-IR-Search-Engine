Owners of Hoo Zoo and Dinosaur World, in Preston upon the Weald Moors, Telford, said it was \"everyone's worst nightmare\", but confirmed no animals were hurt. \"The cause is still not confirmed but it is thought that a new heat lamp may have been faulty,\" a statement said. The lemurs were in the forest at the time of the blaze, said the owners, who praised staff for their actions. Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service said it was made aware of the fire at about 13:10 GMT on Friday and sent two appliances to the scene.\"As you can see the lemur shed is totally gutted along with some of the framework of the enclosure,\" they said.They added the animals had heated beds in the forest \"so will be fine\" while repairs are carried out.A crowdfunding page has also been created to help towards costs of the rebuild.
