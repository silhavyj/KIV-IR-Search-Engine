January was the first month of post-Brexit trading arrangements. This meant Great Britain goodsfaced a range of new customs and regulatory controls when entering Ireland . Some of the decline may have been influenced by stockpiling; imports of Great Britain chemical and pharma products were by down by 60% but that followed a spike in imports during December. There may also have been some pandemic factors, for example the lockdown of hospitality may have had an effect on food imports. However, food imports from the wider EU were only down by 13%.

However, trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland increased compared to last year. Imports from Northern Ireland were up by 10% from \u20ac161m (\u00a3137m) euros to \u20ac177m (\u00a3151m) while exports to Northern Ireland were up 17% from \u20ac170m (\u00a3145) to \u20ac199m (\u00a3170m).
