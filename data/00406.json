The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) had also accused the game company of sexual discrimination.It was one of a number of such allegations against the firm, which is also facing a case filed by the state of California. Activision continues to deny wrongdoing as part of the EEOC settlement.The company - which makes massively popular games such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Overwatch - said the agreement was \"part of its effort to have the most welcoming, inclusive workplace\". The EEOC is the US body responsible for enforcing federal - not state - laws around employment discrimination.

We thank the EEOC for its constructive engagement as we work to fulfil our commitments to eradicate inappropriate conduct in the workplace.\"However, the EEOC legal case is only one of several Activision Blizzard is facing over allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination.California's Department of Fair Employment and Housingtook legal action against the company in July, following a two-year investigation . It accuses the firm and some of its male employees of widespread sexual harassment - what it calls a \"frat boy\" culture.Following that case, some of Activision's investors filed legal cases against the firm in August forallegedly concealing the damaging allegations from shareholders .And a workers' rights group, Communication Workers of America,has filed a case with the US National Labor Relations Board alleging the company has prevented the discussion of workplace activities protected by law, and allegedly \"threatened employees that they cannot talk about or communicate about wages, hours and working conditions\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58720517"}
