Reeves's brother Fin said he was \"blown away\" with it and looking forward \"to giving him a nod\" whenever he passes. \"I'm a little bit blown away and lost for words,\" he said. \"I'll be able to walk past and give him a quick nod every time I walk down the street so it is such a nice thing.\" He said he thought it was \"important\" for the town, too, \"to come together and remember Viola Beach and celebrate their lives\".Tom Murphy, who created the frieze, unveiled the artwork. Warrington Council leader councillor Russ Bowden described the memorial as a fitting tribute. \"The frieze is a celebration of Jack, River, Kris, Tom and Craig, their achievements, and their iconic music,\" he said.
