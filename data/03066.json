West Yorkshire Police call handlers posted about the incident in a tweet, using the hashtag #not999. The force wrote: \"If you are not allowed in, dialling police on 999 is not going to gain you entry either.\" Officers also highlighted an earlier incident in which a child dialled 999 twenty times. They said the calls were \"totally unnecessary\" and could affect people attempting to make genuine emergency calls. West Yorkshire Police previously published a series of YouTube videos to highlight some of the bizarre requests received by call handlers. In one, a man complained he was being held at Leeds railway station after one of his friends was sick on the floor. He told police: \"They won't let us go until we've cleaned it up, and I've asked for a mop and bucket.\" Other so-called emergencies included a man being refused entry to a casino, a rat behind someone's wardrobe, and a request for police to go and turn somebody's electricity back on. Earlier this year, a man also dialled 999 to complain he had ordered a takeaway but a cash machine had swallowed his cash card. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
