In July, the chief executive of Newry, Mourne and Down District Council wrote to the PM and the Republic of Ireland's agriculture minister calling for an all-Ireland register. Forty-five people were banned from keeping animals in NI in 2018 . Animal welfare charities want details of those banned to be shared, making it harder for them to obtain new animals. USPCA Chief Executive Brendan Mullan said the current situation meant someone could be \"banned one day and owning and abusing animals the next\". Julian Smith said he has brought it to the attention of the Northern Ireland Civil Service. In a letter to the council the secretary of state said: \"This issue is devolved in Northern Ireland and therefore for the Northern Ireland Civil Service to consider in the absence of an Executive.\" For its part, the Irish government issued a letter stating the matter will be brought to the attention of Michael Creed, the minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, \"at the next practical juncture\". Newry, Mourne and Down District Council will consider the responses at a meeting on Monday night. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-49522312"}
