Thames Valley Police previously said officers drove into the cow, which had charged into a woman and an officer, on 13 May after all other options were ruled out.Resident Shana Tolsma said she saw them use a van to ram the \"scared looking animal\" four times on Wokingham Road.A vigil was later held for the cow by Vegan Action for Animals campaign group, which claimed it had been \"wrongfully murdered\".
