Paul Givan said the change would take effect from Friday, 21 January. But people will need to produce negative lateral flow tests on days five and six of their isolation. Mr Givan said he was also hopeful more Covid restrictions could be lifted when the executive meets on Thursday. England had alreadymoved to change its policy on self-isolation rules earlier this month . People who still test positive on these days must stay in isolation until they have had two negative tests taken on consecutive days, or after 10 days. The rules apply whether someone is vaccinated or not. The Stormont Executive had been facing calls from businesses facing staff shortages due to the Omicron variant, to bring its policy into line with England.
