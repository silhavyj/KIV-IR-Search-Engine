A live band will play specially-commissioned music.Rambert's artistic director Benoit Swan Pouffer said the production, picking up the story of the gang in post-World War One Birmingham, would be an \"uplifting and inspiring\" show. \"It's such an exciting opportunity as a choreographer to tell these stories and recreate these characters through dance.\" \"This is dance for people who don't usually watch dance and what I've written has been transformed into something startling by consummate dancers and choreographers.\" added Knight.Peaky Blinders, which stars Cillian Murphy, first aired on BBC Two nine years ago to widespread critical acclaim. The sixth and final BBC TV series is set to air this year after Covid-related production delays. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
