Colin Mann, leader of the Plaid Cymru group at Caerphilly council, suggested the idea at a meeting on Monday. Mr Mann said many councillors did not want to \"mix up\" council business with their personal business, but some disagreed with him. A poll is now taking place and the results will be announced at the next committee meeting. The committee was discussing a draft report by the Independent Remuneration Panel for Wales, which is recommending a \u00a32,500 pay rise, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service . Mr Mann, who represents Llanbradach ward, said there were already several councils in Wales providing its members with a mobile phone - enabling them to access council work emails on the go. Labour's Adrian Hussey, who represents Newbridge, disagreed with the idea. He said: \"I have had my council emails coming through my [personal] phone for about three years \u2026 and personally I do not think councillors need to have a phone supplied by a council because most people have got a mobile phone.\" Committee members agreed they would poll all councillors before making a decision.
