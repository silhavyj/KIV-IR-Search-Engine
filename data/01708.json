Nicholas Owen, 35, who owns Solar Tanning on The Pithay, in Paulton, Somerset, was accused of a \"complete lack of regard for residents\". Following a complaint, police found the front door open and receipts showing customers had purchased services on 11 and 12 January. Owen was fined \u00a35,000 and ordered to pay \u00a32,500 costs by Bath magistrates. The court was told a police officer visited the salon on 12 January and that although no one was present, there was a sign on the reception desk offering tanning facilities and giving a phone number to call. Bath and North East Somerset Council brought the prosecution after Owen failed to pay a \u00a31,000 fixed penalty notice. Following the hearing, councillor Paul Crossley, cabinet member for community services, said: \"Owen's rule breaches are an exceptional case.\"In the middle of January, when Covid-19 deaths nationally were at over 1,000 per day, he opened his shop with little apparent regard for potential virus transmission.\"Beauty salons were among the non-essential services which were required to remain closed during the third national lockdown.They were permitted to reopen on 12 April as restrictions eased.Follow BBC West on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
