The crew of the Nimrod TO30, based at Newlyn, Cornwall, found the pollution while fishing south of the Isles of Scilly. Vessel bossessaid on Facebook those onboard spent more than an hour pulling it from the water. Skipper Ben Rowse said: \"That plastic would have been in the sea for God knows how many years if we didn't.\" Mr Rowse, of the Real Cornish Crab Co, said he believed it \"would have easily killed thousands of animals\". \"So I feel good about taking the time to do that,\" he added.
