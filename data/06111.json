The pier first opened in 1904, before being destroyed by two fires, the first in 1930 and the second in 2008.The pier in its current form was opened in October 2010. Co-owner Michelle Michael said they wanted to bring some \u201clight relief\u201d and \u201csomething new to the landscape\u201d. The photos will be on display during October. \u201cThe pier is an iconic landmark, it is a grade II listed building, and most people in our locality will have a pier memory of some description,\u201d Ms Michael said.\u201cWe decided that we would try and resonate with as many generations as we could.\u201d Photographs of the Victorian and 1930s pavilions will be placed on the towers in \u201ca way never done before\u201d, Ms Michael said. \u201cPeople can reminisce about the pier that they remember,\u201d she added. The photographs will be visible from the prom or the road, although \u201cin order to appreciate the scale of it\u201d Ms Michael said you would have to go onto the pier itself.Ms Michael said the photos would \u201cevoke memories\u201d for locals and visitors alike.The fire in 2008 completely destroyed the 1930s pavilion, which then underwent a \u00a339m transformation to bring it back to life.Ms Michael said it was \u201ca very difficult time\u201d.\u201cWe had the fire in 2008 and were then hit by the 2009 recession, followed by three very wet summers,\u201d Ms Michael said.Due to Covid-19 restrictions the attraction closed from March until 4 July, but despite a difficult year, Ms Michael said: \u201cWe\u2019re grateful that we are still here and trading, and this is our way of doing the next thing.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-54512386"}
