Stephen Lewis-Brammer began his task in June 2020 to ride the 40,075km (24,901 miles) on an exercise bike in his kitchen in Stoke-on-Trent. He expected it to take up to five years but is on course to finish in June 2023. \"There are days when I do not feel like it,\" Mr Lewis-Brammer admitted.\"There are days when I do not feel like dripping sweat and carrying on with it, but then you think of what it is for and you get on the bike and I am always glad that I have done a session.\" Mr Lewis-Brammer fits the cycling in around his work and family life and aims to complete 150-175km (93-109 miles) each week. He wants to raise \u00a310,000 for Cancer Research UK as he said he had family, friends and work colleagues affected by the disease. Despite having to take two weeks off recently for a muscle strain, he has already clocked up 19,074km (11,852 miles). Having previously completed a 1,000-km (621-mile) running challenge, he said he had then come up with his latest \"crazy idea\".Mr Lewis-Brammer said: \"I thought I would ride my bike and ride around the world, but at that point I had not realised just how far it was.\" His daughter Jessica said she was \"really, really proud\" of her dad and his challenge was \"really inspiring\".
