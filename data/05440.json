Final-year students from social work, nursing and medicine degrees will join the NHS in the coming weeks. Students from Queen\u2019s University Belfast and Ulster University approaching the end of their final clinical placements have been asked to join the profession early. Eden Baker, 23, who is a final-year children\u2019s nursing student at Queen's said it was \"nerve-wracking\" but she was ready. \"I\u2019ve had almost three years of training,\" she said.\u201cSo it\u2019s important to get out there and contribute the skills that I\u2019ve got.\u201d The Nursing and Midwifery Council has worked with \u202fgovernment\u202f departments to develop legislation to enable final-year students within six months of registration to go into the NHS in a paid capacity. They will undertake all the duties of a final-year student to complete the learning outcomes of their programme, while working in hospitals and healthcare settings across Northern Ireland.Ms Baker had 14 weeks left on her degree which she is now completing on placement as a paid staff nurse rather than a student nurse. \u201cI was nervous because it\u2019s a big thing going from being a student nurse to a staff nurse and I wasn\u2019t really planning to start working as a staff nurse until September or October,\" she said. She added although there were some nerves around working in hospitals where the virus would be, she hoped adequate PPE (personal protection equipment) would be provided. \"Nobody wants to pass anything on to vulnerable patients which is why it\u2019s really important that we have the proper PPE to protect patients as well as ourselves,\" she said. James Cutlan, 28, is a final-year postgraduate medical student at Queen\u2019s. He was due to finish his degree in July, but next week he will register with the General Medical Council and be licensed to practice as a junior doctor.\u201cWe were due to qualify as junior doctors in July but they\u2019ve introduced a foundation interim year purely to help with coronavirus,\" he said. \u201cWe were asked to fill out a national survey to say whether we\u2019d like to do it, which I have done and I\u2019m really keen to help as much as I can and get stuck in as quickly as I can.\u201d Junior doctors will be expected to handle patients who do not have coronavirus, to allow more experienced doctors to work in Covid-19 wards. It is not compulsory for students to join the NHS early, but many are choosing to do so to provide support to clinical teams on the front line. \u201cI do get worried, as I\u2019m sure a lot of medical students and professionals are at the moment, but we get training in PPE to prevent yourself from getting coronavirus,\" Mr Cutlan said. \u201cPersonally I\u2019m raring to go and ready to help as much as I can. \u201cIf that means dealing with patients who have coronavirus, I\u2019m more than happy to do that.\u201d Nicole Jackson, 25, a final-year social work student at Ulster University is having her graduation fast-tracked to qualify as a practising social worker, a few months earlier than planned. \u201cI was on placement in a GP hospital setting and I got an email that that would be our last day on placement, which came as a bit of a shock,\" she said. \u201cWith social work, you can never really be prepared for what you\u2019re going into anyway, so it\u2019s more just having confidence going into work earlier. \u201cI feel competent enough to carry out the role because we\u2019ve been doing it on placement.\u201d She added she was worried about potentially coming into contact with the virus at work, as she has family members with underlying health conditions. \u201cWe\u2019ll be working with vulnerable adults in hospitals and nursing homes so that will come part and parcel with coronavirus,\" she said. \u201cMy family definitely are nervous for me and some people don\u2019t understand why you\u2019d still want to go into work early in the current climate. \u201cYou think being a student is stressful and going into the unknown, but this is going to be going into the unknown as a professional. \u201cI know it\u2019ll be difficult, but it will be very good to experience working during this crisis. \u201cIt is sad though not having that closure with uni and with the friends you\u2019ve made over the past few years.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-52232622"}
