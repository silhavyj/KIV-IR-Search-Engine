Officers were called to Agincourt Avenue in the early hours of Tuesday over reports of a large party. Police said officers were verbally abused and had bottles thrown at them and a man, 18, was arrested on suspicion of disorderly behaviour and possession of an offensive weapon. A 19-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of disorderly behaviour. Both men have since been released pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS). Police also issued six COV4 and three COV2 tickets at a separate house party in the area. COV4 notices carry a minimum fine of \u00a3200 whichreplaced the previous \u00a360 penalty notice from 12 November. A prohibition notice on commercial premises or private gatherings is issued in the form of a COV2 ticket, with police describing it as a warning against continuing to breach regulations. SDLP MP for South Belfast Claire Hanna described the street party as \"absolute madness\" and \"pig ignorant\" in a tweet. There have been several instances of gatherings in the Holyland area during the pandemic that have been against the Covid-19 regulations.
