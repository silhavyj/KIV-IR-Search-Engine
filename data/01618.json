Eve was found in a bin in Durham while Juniper was discovered abandoned near Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire. To help prepare their return to the wild, they have been housed together at a wildlife centre in Cheshire. The RSPCA said Valentine's Day would involve a tasty fish meal followed by \"cuddling up on their blanket\". Lee Stewart, manager at Stapeley Grange wildlife centre, said the pups were \"loving spending time together\". He added: \"Enrichment is important for the mental wellbeing of our patients and the otters enjoy playing in a paddock with straw and chasing each other around.\"They are also very fond of the fish dishes we provide and like snuggling up after a long day of scampering around.\" He said Eve, who was found abandoned on Christmas Eve, and Juniper would be released together at a suitable location later in the year.
