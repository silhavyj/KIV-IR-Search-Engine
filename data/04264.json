Runners gathered to show their respects ahead of his funeral in Tameside.Steve Kenyon, former England international runner, said: \"The first time I saw him race was in January 1967.\"It was the Lancashire Cross Country Championship at Leverhulme Park in Bolton. \"I'd won the boys' race that day - I was 15 - and Ron won the senior race and I remember thinking 'gosh I wish I could run like that'.\" Geoff Norman, former Olympic marathon runner, can remember how Hill was always supportive and on hand to give advice.\"Whether you were front of the field or back of the field, he talked to everybody.\" In 1970, Hill became the first Briton to win the Boston Marathon, breaking the course record, and won Commonwealth gold the same year. He also ran at least one mile every single day for 52 years and 39 days from 20 December 1964 to 31 January 2017 before ending his streak aged 78.
