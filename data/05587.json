The Irish Road Haulage Association says it costs five times more to tax a six-axle truck registered in the Republic of Ireland than in Northern Ireland.The drivers also protested against a \u00a310 levy for entering the UK.During the protest on Monday morning, which has now ended, trucks were blocked from leaving the port.IRHA President Eoin Gavin said its members were dismayed that the Irish government had not addressed the differential in last week's budget.The UK government's HGV Road User Levy began operating in April.It means that trucks from the Republic of Ireland and other European countries have to pay between \u00a385 and \u00a31,000 a year to enter the UK. The government said it was aimed at creating a level playing field, as UK truckers have to pay tolls on European roads.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29685352"}
