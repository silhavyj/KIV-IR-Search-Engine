Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said the one-year-old girl known as Asha and her mother would be placed in community detention in Australia. Protesters blockaded the hospital to prevent the child being removed.Australia's policy on asylum seekers has been widely criticised. Previously, the government said it would stand firm on its asylum seeker policy amid the protests over the child's impending deportation to Nauru. It argues that its offshore detention policy is necessary, and aimed at preventing asylum seekers trying to reach Australia on unseaworthy boats. Australia's High Court upheld Australia's asylum policy as legal under the country's constitution in a decision handed down at the beginning of February.
