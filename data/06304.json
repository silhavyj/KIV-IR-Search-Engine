Ivy Spriggs, 91, and Daphne Holloway, 88, died in a blaze at Newgrange Care Home in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, on 8 April 2017. Newgrange of Cheshunt Ltd runs the home and admitted five charges of failing to comply with fire safety legislation.The company was fined \u00a3175,000 and will have to pay some prosecution costs. Some 33 residents were rescued, three of whom needed hospital treatment for burns and the effects of breathing in smoke. The cause of the fire was found to be from an electrical fault which spread to the roof.Speaking after the sentencing at St Albans Crown Court, Hertfordshire's chief fire officer Darryl Keen said: \"This incident highlights the need for all business owners to ensure they fully comply with fire safety legislation.\"If enough competent staff had been present and properly trained to carry out long-established and recognised guidance on evacuations in a care home I am sure that a full evacuation would have been started long before our arrival.\"Evacuation of a care home is a difficult task and needs to be properly considered and practised so that everyone can escape unharmed.\" The fire service has since undertaken further inspections of the county's care homes, according to a spokesman for Hertfordshire County Council, which runs the fire service. The council said the amount of prosecution costs the company will have to pay is to be negotiated. The BBC has approached Newgrange of Cheshunt Ltd for comment.
