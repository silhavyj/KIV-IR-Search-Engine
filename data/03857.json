The environmental body also said booms and pads in riverways, placed to absorb oil and petrol running off the site, had also been removed. \"These protection measures are vital in helping our officers to minimise the amount of damage caused to the environment and the wildlife that depends on the river, as well as helping to make them safe for the local community to enjoy,\"NRW officers now replacing the barriers as the clean-up operation continues. \"In the interest of people's safety, whilst the clean-up operation is ongoing, we would ask people to continue to avoid contact with the water and not allow any children or pets to enter the river,\" they said.
