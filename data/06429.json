The plans for the city's Bargate Quarter were revised following the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The developer, Tellon Capital,altered the scheme last month to drop a 240-bedroom hotel and add more flats suitable for \"home-working\". The number of flats has gone up from 287 to 519 and the shopping area has been scaled back to about a third. The hotel was added to the previous plans a year ago instead of 185 units of student accommodation.Tellon Capital said the changes had been made to focus on the positive aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic, \"such as the fact more people are walking and cycling\". It said the final plans include secure cycle spaces and electric vehicle charging points, with garden areas to make a feature of the medieval walls. Buildings along Queensway and East Street and the Bargate Shopping Centre have already been demolished ahead of work starting on the redevelopment.
