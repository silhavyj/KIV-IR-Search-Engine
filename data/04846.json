Lee Andrew, 33, was found seriously injured in the building in St Helens, Merseyside, on 2 August last year and was pronounced dead later in hospital. Thomas Brown, of no fixed address, was found guilty at Liverpool Crown Court of his murder. The 42-year-old was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 18 years in prison. Merseyside Police said officers arrested Brown a short time after the attack. Temporary Det Supt Simon Vaughan, who led the murder investigation, said: \"This was a horrendous attack which left Lee Andrew fatally wounded. \"Brown claimed that he was acting in self-defence, but the jury saw through his lies, and he was convicted of murder.\" The officer said he hoped the verdict would bring Mr Andrew's family \"some sense of closure\".
