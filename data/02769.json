The steepness of Old Oswestry Hillfort makes cutting back the bracken difficult, and left untreated it could damage the archaeology of the site. The sheep, which arrived in May, thrive on \"rough grassland and heath\".They are similar to those that would have previously been farmed in the area, say volunteers. Built and occupied during the Iron Age, Oswestry is is one of Britain's best-preserved hillforts and has been protected since 1934 as a Scheduled Monument Native to the British Isles, the Soay/Hebridean cross-breed has taken up residence in the hillfort's southern half. Helen Allen of English Heritage said: \"Over time, bracken has re-established itself on the hillfort, which can cause damage to underlying archaeology. \"The scale of the site and steepness of the slopes make it hard to cut the bracken back, so we consulted with our grazier and a local agricultural college on sustainable solutions that could be integrated into our ongoing landscape management. \"As a result, we decided to experiment with intensive sheep grazing in conjunction with other mechanical means to control the bracken cover.\" Bernard Walker, landscape manager at English Heritage, said the introduction of the sheep will help support the management of the site by volunteers from the Oswestry Heritage Gateway Group and \"will help us all to protect the hillfort's legacy so that people can continue to discover and enjoy the site\".Neil Phillips, from the group said, so far, \"people enjoy having the sheep there\".Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
