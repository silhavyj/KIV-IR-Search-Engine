Almost 25,000 emergency calls were received by South Wales Police last month - more than the force has had ever had in a single month. The total of 24,265 calls is equivalent to nearly 783 a day, almost 33 an hour, or more than one every two minutes. Dyfed-Powys Police said emergency calls had also hit record levels in July. The forces are now urging people only to dial 999 in an emergency, to keep lines free for people in immediate need. Gwent Police also said it had recently had an increase in calls. \"Our public service centre also received more than 42,059 non-emergency calls during July, an average of a further 57 calls an hour,\" South Wales Police said. The force said it was contacted about 18,500 times though Facebook, Twitter or its website in July. Dyfed-Powys Police said it was experiencing an \"unprecedented increase\" in 999 and 101 calls.
