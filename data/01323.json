The supermarket chain's headquarters in Great Wilson Street was evacuated after a \"suspect package\" was discovered among items of mail just after 11:00 BST. A police cordon was put in place and surrounding roads were sealed off. An investigation by Army bomb disposal officers found the parcel contained returned electrical products.
