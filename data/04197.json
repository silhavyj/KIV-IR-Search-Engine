The tree, in Ruddington, Nottinghamshire, was pulled down by the parish council after being battered by Storm Ciara in February. It had been a popular shaded spot for residents on the village's green. Austin Shaw said the cuttings had started to form roots and will be used to replace the tree with a \"clone\". He said: \"We brought samples of the old tree home, simply as a collectible pieces of many happy memories. \"I've known for some time that the willow will grow if simply stuck in the ground. What I didn't know is that this particular species clones itself.\" Mr Shaw said he placed a dozen cuttings in water and was \"delighted\" when they started to form roots and could be potted up. He has agreed to donate one to the parish council so it can be planted on the spot where the original tree stood. Councillor Jennifer Walker said: \"It's a truly inspiring, green-fingered, initiative. I can't wait to see it planted on our green - making the loss of our beloved village willow tree in Storm Ciara easier to take.\" Mr Shaw said it would take several decades for the willow saplings to grow into full-size trees. He said: \"We'll definitely not be around when the trees become mature but I believe the idea has the potential to bring hope for the future of the village when this awful time we're now dealing with has passed.\" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , Twitter , or Instagram .
