Offshore Europe had been due to take place at the P&J Live venue in Aberdeen next month as the biennial event could not be held last year.However organisers said it would not be in the best interests of exhibitors, attendees and staff to proceed in the current climate. It will be rescheduled for 5-8 September 2023.Jonathan Heastie, of Reed Exhibitions, said it was a complex process to postpone such a large event and the decision had been made with a \"heavy heart\".
