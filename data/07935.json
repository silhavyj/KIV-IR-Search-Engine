BBC meteorologist Chris Fawkes said the halos are caused by ice crystals high in the atmosphere.He added: \"All the photos actually have a complete cover of Cirrostratus cloud made of ice crystals, these ice crystals reflect and refract the sunlight to produce these optical phenomena.\" The same effect is sometimes seen when it is a clear night with a full moon and the thin layer of cirrus moves across the moonlit sky.
