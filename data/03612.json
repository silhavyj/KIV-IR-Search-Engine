Mark Drakeford wants tooffer a Covid booster to all adults by the end of the year . Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said she hopes that everyone takes up the offer of having their vaccine.The Welsh government said : \"Please wait to be invited, your health board will contact you when it is your turn.\" If you have received your first and second doses, you will be contacted by either text, phone call or letter, three months after your second dose for your booster appointment.Health Minister Eluned Morgan added: \"Some people will be asked to come to a walk-in slot at one of the newly-extended vaccine clinics.\" Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board and Swansea Bay University Health Board have said they will be sending out texts and letters offering appointments.Hywel Dda University Health Board and Powys Teaching Health Board will be sending out texts and letters, as well as having targeted age range drop-ins.Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board will send out letters and have an online booking system. The advice is not to contact your GP or health board to ask about appointments, unless you haven't received your first or second vaccines. In Wales, if you're over 18 and it's been three months since your second dose, you can get a booster. This is in line withguidance from the UK government's vaccination advisers , the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Boosters will be offered in order of descending age groups, with priority given to the vaccination of older adults at-risk.If you have tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks (28 days) from the date of the test before having your booster. Boosters will be offered at vaccination centres across Wales.The Welsh government was previously aiming for NHS Wales to givemore than 200,000 vaccines a week . But in light of the threat from Omicron, this is now being significantly ramped up.The JCVI has recommended Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The JCVI reviewed data on booster responses from different combinations of Covid vaccines. This has shown both these vaccines are well tolerated as a booster dose and will provide a strong immune response. This is irrespective of which vaccine was given as a primary dose. Most people will receive a text, phone call or letter to allocate them a booster appointment but health boards will operate some walk-in sessions on an age basis for anyone who may not have been contacted or who cannot make their allocated appointment. Welsh government has advised people to check their local health board's website and social media over the coming days for arrangements and eligibility.They're currently open 09:00 to 20:00, but opening times are being extended to meet demand. Vaccinations will be given every day over the festive period apart from Christmas Day and Boxing Day. Children aged 12-15are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab . Teenagers aged 16 and 17 can book their second dose of Pfizer, 12 weeks after their first. No vaccine is currently approved for under-12s in the UK. Anyone over 12, with a severely weakened immune system, has been offered a third vaccine, plus a booster. If you're over 65 and live in a care home, you will be prioritised at the start of every vaccination programme. People who are homeless, or have recently experienced homelessness, will be offered a booster dose first, as advised by the JCVI. Outreach teams and pop up clinics are dispatched to vaccinate. The evidence so far suggests thatOmicron may be more infectious than previous variants , and that existing vaccines may beless effective at stopping it. . However, early studies suggest a booster can prevent around75% of people getting symptoms. The World Health Organization (WHO) says thatexisting vaccines should still protect people who contract Omicron from severe illness. You can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second. Adults cancontact their local health board to book an appointment.Themost common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea. This is part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to disappear within a day or two. A very small number of people have experienced asevere allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine. You should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated. You can volunteerthrough your local health board. All positive tests are tested to identify probable Omicron variant, which takes a few days. Immediate public health action is taken on identification of a probable case of omicron variant and contact tracers will inform the individual of this.
