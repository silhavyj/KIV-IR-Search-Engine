Dr Lika Nehaul, of PHW, said: \"The cases identified are of the non-infectious form of TB and therefore pose no risk to the wider community. \"These individuals have been informed and have been offered clinical care and support following long established clinical guidelines.\"Given the very small number of cases of latent TB infection, we have not recommended further screening in the school, but will continue to monitor the situation and have informed local GPs.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-60337763"}
