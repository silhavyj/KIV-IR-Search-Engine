Runcorn Swimming Pool in Bridge Street was described as \"unsustainable\" by Halton Council which proposed shutting it as part of cost-saving measures. Halton MP Derek Twigg said many residents were against the closure and added it would have a \"negative\" impact on their health.The council argues user numbers were low compared to other leisure sites.It said the pool, which is housed in the former market hall, required \"major investment\" and Brookvale Recreation Centre could be used by residents.Mr Twigg proposed instead of closing the pool it could be refurbished as part of the town centre's transformation, theLocal Democracy Reporting Service said.In 2021 Runcorn won \u00a323m in funding to create housing, leisure, employment and training projectsas part of the government's Towns Fund deal . The council said the market hall building would be considered as part of the funding, but not the swimming pool itself.Mr Twigg said if the baths were \"given the chance to survive\", the facility could become an \"intrinsic part of the leisure offer\" in the town.\"Decreasing the availability of being able to swim could have a negative impact on local people's health and wellbeing, leading to increased costs in the long run on other services,\" he said. The council is due to discuss the proposals on Thursday.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram ?
