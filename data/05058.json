Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service group manager Martyn Doolin said the blaze was contained to the basement. Thames Valley Police said an investigation was under way to establish the cause of the fire. Det Ch Insp Rich Jarvis said: \"This was a significant incident, which thankfully has not resulted in anybody being injured. \"However, there were people inside the property, this could have had a far worse outcome had it not been for their swift actions to get out of the building.\" He appealed for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area at the time, or anyone with CCTV or dashcam footage, to contact police.
