New Welsh Language Minister Eluned Morgan, who was promoted to the position two weeks ago, said she was looking at the possibility.In August, Ms Morgan's predecessor Alun Davies announced the Welsh language commissioner rolewas being scrapped . A target of one million Welsh speakers by 2050 wasunveiled last year. The Welsh Language Commissioner Meri Huws' responsibilities include promoting andfacilitating the use of the Welsh language. Ms Morgan told Newyddion 9: \"The public service ombudsman has expressed an interest in taking over that role.\"He certainly has quite an effective office but whether he has all the tools available and an understanding of what needs to be done, we are looking at that at the moment.\"It is a possibility but one of many possibilities but at the moment I have got an open mind.\" When the plan to scrap the role was announced, the Welsh Government said it wanted to create a Welsh Language Commission to promote the language instead of having a single figurehead. Like the current commissioner, the body would also be responsible for policing the system. Campaigners at Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg have raised concerns it would lead to a weakening of Welsh-speakers' rights. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-42059930"}
