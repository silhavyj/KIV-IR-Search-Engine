Det Supt James Riccio said: \"Mariella Gedge-Rogers did not deny taking part in the horrible events in Bristol city centre that night but claimed she acted alone and not as part of a group. \"The evidence presented to the jury however clearly showed her joining forces with others on the roof of the police station to hurl missiles at officers.\"She was also captured handing her skateboard, which she had used as a weapon, to another individual for them to use. \"The jury were subsequently left with little choice but to conclude she was not acting alone but was part of a violent mob.\" The jury unanimously found Gedge-Rogers guilty of a charge of being part of a group which used or threatened violence and together, caused others to fear for their personal safety. She will be the 15th person to be sentenced in connection with the disorder. Follow BBC West on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
