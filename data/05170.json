Simon Adderley said he wanted to sell his 2,625ft (800m)-long stretch of sand dunes at Ingoldmells to someone with \"a real affinity\" with nature. He said he was dividing the land, which he had owned for 15 years, and selling each plot for \u00a340,000. \"We've had over a thousand emails in five days,\" said Mr Adderley. \"We've had over 700 people express a proper interest and over 200 people make an offer, so a crazy few days.\" Mr Adderley said he wanted a \"custodian\" for the beach and was determined not to sell the 328ft (100m)-wide plots to \"just anyone\". \"We're basically selling them to people that have a real affinity with the nature and the love of the coast and wild places. \"We've had some really beautiful stories: people who've lost people through Covid or families who've lost a really significant person and they're buying for legacies, to just have somewhere to come for solitude. \"It's a beautiful place,\" he added.
