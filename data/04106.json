Almost 200 properties in the borough were flooded on Wednesday,some for the third time this year , with Pentre and Maerdy the worst hit.Plaid Member of the Senedd (MS) for the Rhondda, Leanne Wood, said people were angry and called for an inquiry. But council leader Andrew Morgan said it would take too long and a plan would be in place over the next few days. He told BBC Radio Wales: \"An independent inquiry could take many, many months, I think what the residents want is action.\" He said a major investigation was under way \"right now with contractors and our own staff\" and a number of factors could have contributed to the floods, including water running down the mountainside or the possibility a pumper station tripped out. \"It may well be the drain system in the area can no longer cope, in which case we have to make significant investment,\" he said. \"It could well be the system was simply overloaded, and therefore we need to look at all the facts before jumping to conclusions. \"We will be putting resources in to make sure this is tackled - it can't happen again.\" Mr Morgan said he had support from the Welsh Government, the secretary of state for Wales and the first minister. But in a tweet, Ms Wood urged people to sign a petition demanding politicians hold a full, independent inquiry.
