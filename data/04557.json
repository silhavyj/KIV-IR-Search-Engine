The letter from Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden expressed their \"deep gratitude\" to Sam Rodman, a Cornish Pirates player. Mr Rodman told the BBC he assumed it was fake when he opened it. He worked for a private firm at the Tregenna Castle Hotel, St Ives, where many dignitaries stayed in June 2021. Mr Rodman said he was \"very chuffed\" to have received it.\"I got a text off [the security company] a few weeks ago saying 'we've got something that's been sent to you'.\"It came in the post, I opened it and it was a letter from Joe Biden and the First Lady, from the White House. I was very surprised and shocked to be honest, I thought it was fake.\"I spoke to the people at the [security] company and they said about 15 people got it and I was one of them,\" he said. In their letter the Bidens said: \"We remain deeply grateful for your tireless efforts and support.\" The journey to Cornwall for the global summit was the couples' first international trip as President and First Lady. \"It was a very good week, I really enjoyed it there, I met some wonderful people and it was just a great experience,\" Mr Rodman added.
