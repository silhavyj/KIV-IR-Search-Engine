NRW said it was appalled by thedamage on the River Llynfi , near Pontithel, Powys, but there was \"no realistic prospect of conviction\". One Powys county councillor tweeted that NRW was \"not fit for purpose\" and another said its response was\"feeble\" . NRW said itcould consider reopening the case if new evidence came to light. The River Llynfi, a tributary to the River Wye, is a Site of Special of Scientific Interest in a special area of conservation. In atweet , Green Party councillor Emily Durrant said she was \"devastated\" by the decision, adding that NRW was \"not fit for purpose if it can't even enforce a major point source pollution event like this one\". Welsh Liberal Democrat councillor William Powell, a former Member of the Senedd,tweeted that it was \"darkest hour in the history\" of the NRW as \"residents... and all fair-minded people have waited patiently for justice\". Ann Weedy, NRW operations manager, said: \"We are very disappointed that we have not been able to bring those responsible to justice.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-59101264"}
