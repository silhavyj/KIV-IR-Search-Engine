The body of Brenda Page, 32, was found in her flat in the city's Allan Street in July 1978. Christopher Harrisson was not present at a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh but pleas of not guilty were entered. A trial date of 22 August at the High Court in Aberdeen was fixed. It is estimated to last 15 days. Mr Harrisson is accused of forcing entry to premises in Allan Street and repeatedly striking Ms Page on the head and body with a blunt implement or implements on 14 July 1978. He is also accused of assaulting her on various occasions between 6 May 1972 and 20 June 1976 in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and elsewhere in Scotland. It is alleged that he repeatedly punched Ms Page on the head, pulled her hair, struck her with books, threw cups and their contents at her, kicked her on the body and knocked her to the ground.
