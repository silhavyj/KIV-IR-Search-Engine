In 2020, the small, flat-faced companions overtook the beloved golden retriever and German shepherds on the American Kennel Club's annual ranking. They are now second, behind Labrador retrievers, which have remained in the top spot for 30 consecutive years. The rankings do not include mixes, mutts or any designer hybrid breeds.
