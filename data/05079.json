The motorway will be closed in both directions between junction 5 for Langley and junction 6 at Slough from 20:00 GMT to 06:00 on Monday.This is for the demolition of the old Riding Court Road bridge near Datchet, Highways England said. The same stretch of motorway had been closed in April to construct the new version of the bridge. The work is part of a project to upgrade the M4 between junctions 3 and 12 to a smart motorway, due for completion in Spring 2022. It comes as traffic volumes on the M4 have \"significantly reduced\" during the coronavirus pandemic.Traffic will be diverted via the A4 and the A355 during the full weekend closure. A Highways England spokesman said: \"In the event of a major incident the M4 team will work with first responders to accommodate emergency access through the closure as required.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-54203145"}
