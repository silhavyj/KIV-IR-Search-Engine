The animal's body was found on the B3054, on the east side of Crockford car park, near Lymington on 26 January. Officers believe the pony had been hit by an Audi A4 car some time during the previous evening because vehicle parts were found nearby. They want to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the accident or knows anything about it. Pc Alison Tilbury said: \"We would also like to hear from any vehicle repair specialist who may have repaired a vehicle matching this description in the days since the incident occurred. \"We would also urge people to drive responsibly and to keep their speeds down at all times, particularly when driving on the open forest roads during the hours of darkness. The animals there roam freely and can often act unpredictably.\" Drivers can be prosecuted if they fail to report an accident involving ponies, donkeys, cattle and pigs, which live in the New Forest.
