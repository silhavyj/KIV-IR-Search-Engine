Thousands voted in Doncaster Council's contest including US singer Curtis Stigers with his offering of Grit Balls o'Fire.Names in the running included Spready Mercury and Basil Salty. The authority said it was \"delighted\" with the result. The council currently has five named gritter vehicles: Brad Grit, Gritney Spears, The Subzero Hero, Mr Plow and Usain Salt. But with the addition of two more, it followed in the footsteps of other authorities asking the public to name the vehicles and put out a plea for suggestions with two conditions, to keep them clean and be original. It sparked an influx of comedy names such as Grit Van Dyke, Walter the Salter, Rule Gritannia and Gritney Houston. In the words of Doncaster Council some were \"good\", others were \"not so good\". Suggestions were then shortlisted by the council's \"comedy panel\" of civil servants and put out to a public vote.They then turned the competition into a 'world cup', using the hashtag #DoncasterGrittingWorldCup. More than 25,000 people have cast their votes in the final, choosing between either Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Anti-Slip Machiney and Spready Mercury and Basil Salty and David Plowie. Social media users said they were \" on the edge of their seats \" waiting for the winning names to be revealed. Deputy Mayor Glyn Jones said: \"It's amazing that so many people have got involved in our gritter naming competition, and some of the suggestions are brilliant.\"We look forward to Usain Salt, David Plowie and the rest of the gang keeping our roads safe this winter.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-42026485"}
