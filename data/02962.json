Mr Justice Colton confirmed inspections on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain must continue pending the outcome of legal challenges. Agriculture Minister Mr Poots hadordered his officials to halt Irish Sea border checks on Wednesday . He had threatened the action as part of the DUP's ongoing opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU to ensure free movement of trade across the Irish land border after Brexit. But unionist politicians have been critical of the arrangements, saying they are damaging Northern Ireland's place in the UK. The High Court development came on Friday as an unidentified member of Sinn F\u00e9in and a second applicant named Edward Rooney.Mr Justice Colton said: \"There shouldn't be any doubt or confusion hanging over those civil servants who have to comply with the law. \"I propose to make an order, suspending the order or instruction given by the Minister for Agriculture until further order of this court or completion of these proceedings.\" Checks on goods along the Irish Sea border have continued despite Mr Poots' order , Downing Street said on Thursday. The prime minister's spokesman said checks were continuing, and that \"we are reviewing the legal position\". Paul Givan also announced his resignation as first minister of Northern Ireland on Thursday. The move was also part of the DUP's protest against the protocol.
