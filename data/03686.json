Dave Heeley, 54, from West Bromwich, who is known as Blind Dave, became Sandwell's 11th honorary freeman. In 2008 he became the first blind person to run seven marathons on seven continents in seven days. The ceremony took place in the council chamber at Sandwell Council House, Oldbury, at noon. Council Leader Councillor Darren Cooper said: \"I am sure he will be a great ambassador for the borough. \"Over the years he has done so much for so many others with his charity runs.\" Mr Heeley said: \"I was initially speechless. I regard it as a great privilege and honour.\" In 2011 he ran 10 marathons in 10 days, travelling from John O'Groats to Land's End in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support. He also cycled between each stage. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-17564168"}
