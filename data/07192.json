The discovery was made by another driver at Sunny Bushes on the B3079 on Tuesday shortly after midnight. The Bay filly foal was so badly injured it had to be immediately put down, police said. Officers believe the offending vehicle was travelling towards Cadnam, near Southampton, and a piece of trim from a Volkswagen was found close by. Drivers can be prosecuted if they fail to report an accident involving ponies, donkeys, cattle and pigs, which live in the New Forest.
