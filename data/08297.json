Mr Biden was speaking on Thursday with a group of senators about the need to upgrade infrastructure in the US.His warning comes the day after his first phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. On the call, Mr Xi took a hard line on human rights saying a confrontation would be a disaster for both countries.Mr Biden made the comments after meeting with members of the Environment and Public Works committee. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get moving, they are going to eat our lunch,\u201d President Biden told senators.\u201cThey\u2019re investing billions of dollars dealing with a whole range of issues that relate to transportation, the environment and a whole range of other things. We just have to step up.\u201d During the campaign, Mr Biden proposed spending $2tn (\u00a31.45tn) over four years to create jobs and invest in clean energy infrastructure. A widely cited American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) \u201creport card\u201d from 2017 gave the country\u2019s infrastructure a grade of \u201cD+\u201d.The ASCE estimated that the total \u201cinfrastructure gap\u201d needed $2tn by 2025 to fix, but would cost the economy twice as much if it went unaddressed.The World Economic Forum\u2019s 2019 Global Competitiveness Report ranked the US 13th in a broad measure of infrastructure quality, down from fifth place in 2002. China has been investing heavily in its infrastructure, pouring money into high-speed rail, metro systems, apartment buildings, electricity grids and mobile networks.\u201cThey have a major, major new initiative on rail and they already have rail that goes 225 miles an hour with ease,\u201d Mr Biden noted. President Biden also discussed several other points of friction with the Chinese President during his call.The White House said he voiced \u201cfundamental\u201d concerns about Beijing\u2019s \u201ccoercive and unfair\u201d trade practices, as well as concerns over China\u2019s crackdown in Hong Kong and treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang.He also raised China\u2019s increasingly assertive posture toward Taiwan and the country\u2019s lack of transparency over Covid-19, said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki.Mr Xi maintained a hard line on Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan, calling them matters of \u201csovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d. He told Mr Biden confrontation would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d and the two sides should re-establish the means to avoid misjudgements, China\u2019s foreign ministry said.
