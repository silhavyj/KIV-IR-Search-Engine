The lido was built at Ynysangharad War Memorial Park in 1927 and shut in 1991. The original site had just one large pool, but the revamped attraction will have three pools, changing rooms and sun terraces. Money for the restoration has come from the Welsh government, Heritage Lottery Fund and Rhondda Cynon Taf council. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-31618398"}
