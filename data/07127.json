Rotherham Council granted approval to build on the Pithouse West opencast colliery site, near Rother Valley Park, South Yorkshire, last month. The 250-acre site will be developed by the Gulliver's Group which operates parks in Warrington and Matlock Bath. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the plans did not require further investigation. More on this and other stories from across Yorkshire Managing director Julie Dalton said she was delighted the project had been given the go ahead. She said the development would give the area \"a huge economic boost\" and create about 250 jobs. Work is due to start later this year, with the attraction scheduled to open in 2020.
