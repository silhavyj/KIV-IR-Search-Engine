Unicode, the organisation which decide which tiny pictures you get on your phone keyboard, have signed off on this and 71 other mini icons. While the avocado, along with the boxing glove, the selfie and the clown, will become official on 21 June, you will have to wait a bit longer before you get them on your mobile. That's because tech companies need to add them to their operating systems.
