Another - G393 - has flown to the Peak District via Suffolk afterspending the winter in Oxfordshire .The birds are four of six eaglesreleased on the Isle of Wight in August as part of a five-year introduction programme by the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation. The third eagle - G318 - is settled in the North York Moors and the fourth eagle - G324 - remains on the Isle of Wight. In Octoberone was found to have died and another remains missing. A Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation spokesman said: \"If you are fortunate to see a white-tailed eagle over your home or garden thenplease report it , but please do remember to stay at home at the present time.\" Also known as sea eagles, they are the UK's largest bird of prey, with a wingspan of up to 8ft (2.5m) and feed feed mainly on fish and water birds. The project will see at least six birds released annually but they are not expected to breed until 2024.White-tailed eagles were once widespread across the UK, but were wiped out about a century ago.The last known breeding pair in England were recorded at Culver Cliff on the Isle of Wight in 1780.
