The pony suffered a broken back in the accident on Pound Lane between Bransgore and Burley on 4 July. A passer-by later found the foal and police and the park authorities were alerted. It died later. Hampshire police are appealing for witnesses and urged drivers to observe speed limits and to be mindful of the animals who roam in the national park. 'Left to suffer' Pc Alison Tilbury, of Hampshire police, said: \"The driver of the vehicle who hit the foal left it to suffer and drove off. \"Thankfully another member of the public stopped to help the foal and stopped it from suffering any further. \"I would like to remind drivers to be mindful of the wealth of wildlife found within the New Forest and to drive carefully and within the speed limit to avoid further incidents. \"I would also like to hear from anyone who can identify the driver responsible for this incident.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/10611700"}
